Abstract
Background
Students’ sense of belonging in college—an individual’s feelings of contentment, mattering,
importance, and “finding one’s place” in a social setting—can influence choice of major and
career trajectory. We contribute to the belongingness literature through a mixed methods
intersectional study of students attending a STEM-focused public university we call Meadow
State University (MSU). We assess the potential for students’ intersecting social identities to
differentially influence their experiences with intersectional oppression—subjection to multi-
ple systems of oppression due to simultaneous membership in more than one marginalized
group—that, in turn, may influence their college pathways. In addition, we explore whether
intersectional differences affect sense of belonging differently in STEM and non-STEM
majors. We employ a mixed-methods approach, informed by critical quantitative methods
and in-depth interviews. We utilize quantitative institutional data measuring college satisfac-
tion, expressed as “willingness to return” to the same university, for over 3,000 students dur-
ing two academic years (2013–14 and 2016–17). Survey data explores college satisfaction
as an indicator of intersectional differences in student experiences. Then, we analyze 37 in-
depth interviews, collected between 2014–2016 at the same institution, to further contextu-
alize the intersectional variation suggested by survey results.
Results
Willingness to return is influenced by major, as well as academic, social, and campus
belonging. Moreover, the extent to which these factors affected outcomes additionally varied
by race/ethnicity, gender, family income, other background factors, and the ways these fac-
tors may intersect. Important components of academic belonging included faculty-student
interactions, perceptions of academic support, and a privileging of STEM degree programs
and students over non-STEM students and their degree programs at MSU. Faculty respon-
siveness and high impact practices like internships played an important role, particularly in
STEM programs. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that, particularly for students of

life shaping belongingness.
Conclusions
Our mixed-methods approach contributes insights into how and why students’ background,
individual choices, and institutional practices concurrently—and intersectionally—influence
their ability to form a sense of belonging on campus. Structural changes are required to end
practices that support intersecting systems of oppression by favoring White, upper-income
men as the “default” STEM students in the U.S. Our research supports growing evidence
that institutions must actively build models of inclusion for underrepresented and marginal-
ized groups that address inequitable and unjust practices, providing transformative mentor-
ing and educational guidance that attends to intersectional oppression, in order to
effectively support the next generation of women and scholars of color.
Introduction
Despite decades of attention to diversity in higher education, research consistently shows that
cisgender women, low-income students, and those who identify as Black, Indigenous, and/or
People of Color (BIPOC) continue to feel marginalized in U.S. colleges more often than cis-
gender men, middle to upper-income, and White students. Marginalization in the academy
describes a range of experiences that stem from being a member of a numerically minoritized
group (e.g., women majoring in mathematics), as well as exclusionary behaviors that can nega-
tively affect minoritized group members’ academic trajectories (e.g., women in mathematics
being interrupted, shut out of leadership positions, and/or subject to gender-based harass-
ment) [1, 2]. Moreover, marginalization remains particularly acute in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields [3–5]. Higher education research connects mar-
ginalization in college to students’ evaluations of satisfaction with their institutions, as well as
variation in developing a strong sense of belonging. These related concepts refer to an individu-
al’s feelings of contentment, mattering, importance, and “finding one’s place” in a social set-
ting [6]. Satisfaction and sense of belonging in university settings vary by individual
background, major, and other social factors, and previous studies demonstrate their impor-
tance for college outcomes [3, 6–10]. Recent social media campaigns like #BlackInTheIvory
and #ShutDownSTEM brought attention to racism in the academy and scientific communi-
ties, calling on academics and scientists to push for equity and inclusion [11, 12]. Such efforts
provide evidence that the opportunity to develop “belongingness” in academia is not universal
[12], and that gendered, racialized, and socioeconomic inequalities within STEM fields remain
an acute problem [13].
Past research documents multiple links between sense of belonging and positive college
outcomes. For example, sense of belonging predicts students’ adjustment to college and inten-
tions to persist [3, 6, 14], reduces probability of withdrawal [15]; and is associated with aca-
demic self-efficacy [16], academic and classroom engagement [17], as well as higher grades
and satisfaction [6]. Nevertheless, there remain few theoretical or policy interventions effec-
tively confronting the continued barriers to belongingness that marginalized students face. We
argue this is because intersecting inequalities influencing development of sense of belonging go

qualitative interviews. The first and second authors
applied to MSU for permission to use these
institutional data. Per MSU’s policy, as well as that
of Virginia Tech’s Human Research Protection

specifically use the NSSE survey fielded at MSU,
and if we were to release these data, the anonymity
of MSU and therefore the confidentiality of

our methods—an endeavor we think would be
highly valuable. Requests for anonymized interview

largely unexamined [18–23]. College experiences are shaped by systems of privilege and disad-
vantage that vary along intersections of gender, ethnoracial identity, and socioeconomic posi-
tion including income and first-generation college-going status [24]. Yet, solutions to
inequalities in the STEM pipeline often focus on a single axis of identity [23, 25]. For example,
policies to diversify “high earning” STEM majors and improve BIPOC outcomes often over-
look how BIPOC students’ barriers vary by gender and income [1, 20, 26]. Examining how col-
lege experiences differ intersectionally is vital for identifying institutional practices that can
strengthen college belonging generally, and broaden STEM participation specifically.
We utilize mixed methods of inquiry and a case study approach to assess the potential for
intersectional oppression—subjection to multiple systems of oppression due to simultaneous
membership in more than one marginalized identity [2]—that differentially influences stu-
dents’ college experiences and sense of belonging. We additionally examine whether and how
different combinations of intersecting identities reflect sense of belonging differently for stu-
dents pursuing STEM and non-STEM majors. Our setting is Meadow State University (MSU),
a STEM-focused, predominantly White institution (PWI) in the Southeast region of the
United States (all names are pseudonyms). In the section that follows, we review the extant lit-
erature connecting identity, experiences, and sense of belonging. We focus on literature that
examines college contexts in the United States (U.S.), because our case is a U.S. university. We
begin by reviewing the related concepts of sense of belonging and satisfaction, and include pre-
vious literature examining factors shown to influence their development. Our review focuses
on two factors in particular: (1) intersectional oppression, and (2) how/why belonging devel-
ops differently in STEM and non-STEM majors. We then offer a guiding theoretical and con-
ceptual framework for our study that is grounded in critical race theory (CRT) and critical
quantitative methods.
Sense of belonging and satisfaction
Social connection is a universal human need, facilitating access to resources and emotional sup-
port that sustain life [27]. Sense of belonging, as a form of social connection, refers to feelings of
fitting in, feeling comfortable, establishing connections, being respected, safety, mattering, and
importance in a social setting [8]. In short, sense of belonging acts as a “glue” connecting peo-
ple to settings. As Strayhorn [6] writes, a sense of belonging “is a basic human need. . . [it]
intersects with and affects social identities” (pp. 122–123). When belongingness is missing,
individuals may not receive the same benefits from their experiences as those with a stronger
sense of belonging [6]. Despite an emphasis on the individual level, previous research high-
lights how belongingness predictably varies due to power asymmetries shaping opportunities
for engagement, resources, and social connections in a given setting.
It is important to note that the very concept of belongingness is burdened by the colonialist,
White supremacist, and cisheteropatriarchal underpinnings of U.S. society in general, and the
histories of many U.S. universities specifically. The historical residue from near-blanket exclu-
sion of BIPOC mere decades ago still exists at universities that were literally built by enslaved
people and shepherded indigenous genocide [28]. Thus, many universities remain “White
spaces” [29]. Nevertheless, in recent years, even predominantly White institutions (PWIs)
have engaged in myriad “diversity projects” intended to increase diversity, inclusion, and
equity on campus; improving underrepresented and excluded students’ sense of belonging as a
means of increasing representation, retention, and academic performance is a frequent goal
[30].
Sense of belonging is a complex construct that can be examined at multiple levels: for exam-
ple, belonging at higher education institutions [6, 16, 31], belonging in STEM generally [9, 32],

and belonging in specific majors [33, 34]. One issue that must be confronted is the variety of
ways that previous research has conceptualized sense of belonging. For example, Maton and
co-authors discuss “sense of community” and “science identity,” [35] while Hazari and co-
authors examine “performance/competence,” “recognition, “interest,” and “sense of belong-
ing” as separate constructs [33]. Nunn [7], a sociologist of education, helpfully melds this con-
stellation of constructs—which we argue are all connected to an overarching sense of
belonging construct. In doing so, Nunn identifies three interrelated areas of belonging that
matter for college students’ experience and outcomes: (1) Academic (feeling competent and
comfortable in classes, labs, one’s major, etc.); (2) Social (connected to friends and social cir-
cles on campus); and (3) Community (feelings of inclusion across campus settings). Yet, lim-
ited research disaggregates sense of belonging to these three areas and examines them
intersectionally [7, 18, 19, 21, 22].
Colleges and universities have long been interested in understanding the factors that can
influence students’ judgment of how satisfied they are with their college experience [10].
Scholars have used multiple measures to assess satisfaction, aiming to capture students’ subjec-
tive assessments of the overall quality of their experience, including whether they have become
“loyal” customers; that is, willing to return to the same institution [36–38]. In this study, we
utilize a survey item designed to capture overall satisfaction (whether students would be “will-
ing to return”) as an indicator of intersectional differences in student experiences. Students’
satisfaction, similar to their academic, social, and community sense of belonging developed
throughout their college experience, remains unequal across multiple axes of difference. Areas
of challenge include, but are not limited to: race/ethnicity [39], gender [40], and family income
and associated factors, (e.g. paid work; first-generation status) [41]. For example, BIPOC stu-
dents are less likely to express satisfaction and a sense of belonging, and students’ campus
diversity climate perceptions are a contributing factor [3, 42]. Though women are graduating
college at higher percentages than men, many academic majors remain gender-segregated,
leading to corresponding satisfaction, belongingness, and career pathway differences [43]. For
example, women, comprising 51% of the U.S. population, are overrepresented among agricul-
tural and biology degree-holders (women earned 64% of these in 2020), yet remain underrep-
resented in physics (43%) and mathematical and computer sciences (26%) [44, 45]. Previous
research has shown that identifying as a first-generation college student, as compared to those
whose parents have completed college, is associated with: a lower-income background; less
access to college-prep curriculum in high school; having received less guidance applying to
and attending college from parents and high school personnel; and lower rates of college per-
sistence, longer time to degree, and lower rates of completion [46–49]. We focus on three key
axes of intersecting differences: race/ethnicity, gender, and family income and associated fac-
tors; yet, we acknowledge important sources of inequality that are out of our study’s scope (i.e.,
dis/ability status, sexuality, citizenship, and age).
STEM inequalities
Reflective of institutions of higher education at large, the right to use and enjoy science—that
is, what science looks like, who engages in science, and what science is used for—is not shared
by all students, but rather, is unequally distributed due to intersecting inequities. The National
Science Foundation considers the social sciences to be STEM fields; however, disciplines such
as Psychology and Sociology report fewer inequalities as compared to so-called “hard” sciences
(such as Physics and Math), and highly technical disciplines (such as Engineering and Com-
puter Science). In the U.S., STEM has historically excluded women and people of color, reserv-
ing STEM identity and participation for White men, processes resulting in what Dancy et al.

[50] term “science as White male property.” Thus, marginalized populations, including those
who identify as BIPOC, low-income, ciswomen, and/or first in their families to attend college
(first-generation), are less likely to attain STEM degrees despite comparable or higher aspira-
tions to do so [51, 52], a pattern not found in other majors [22]. Among well-prepared BIPOC
high school students, 44% of Black students desired STEM careers; however, just 27% of those
interested actually attained STEM bachelor’s degrees [53]. This suggests that barriers within
the STEM major-to-career pipeline disproportionately redirect marginalized students [25].
STEM career attainment is a social process, and the “desire of an aspirant is only one fac-
tor. . .An aspiring scientist relies on the judgment and invitation of practicing scientists
throughout every phase of the educational and career process” [54] (p. 371). That is, inequities
in belongingness, including faculty-student interactions, contribute to high attrition rates
among populations marginalized in STEM [9, 23]. Further, STEM identity development and
sense of belonging are intimately related [23, 55]. Previous research highlights how factors
related to strong identity development such as mentorship, recognition, confidence, and inter-
est are unequally experienced. For example, underrepresented students are less likely to have
positive mentors like themselves in authoritative STEM positions, receive external recognition
and validation of their performance and competence, and thus see themselves as scientists and
feel like they belong [19, 23, 56]. These experiences reflect inadequate strategies to diversify the
professoriate, effectively mentor BIPOC students, and connect them to STEM programs [18,
20]. Positive academic settings foster belongingness, including developing a “science identity,”
while negative STEM climates essentially “weed out” marginalized students [57, 58].
Two survey-based studies complicate these conclusions. Nguyen and Riegle-Crumb [59]
found that eighth-grade young women of color’s positive science-related counter-stereotypes
(e.g., disagreeing with survey items communicating science stereotypes like “most scientists are
geeks or nerds”) were associated with increased intent to major in computer science and engi-
neering in the future. Verdin’s [23] survey of engineering majors at nine institutions affirmed
that women of color were less likely to develop a sense of belonging, but found that identifying
as an engineer was important to persistence while belongingness was not. Our study’s approach
contributes to this complex set of narratives about what factors matter to the social process of
STEM degree attainment by extending our inquiry to compare STEM and non-STEM students,
and pairing students’ qualitative experiences with contemporaneous survey data.
STEM-focused ameliorative programs are increasingly found at U.S. universities. These
programs, often designed for groups that experience marginalization in STEM, aim to improve
students’ belongingness with and retention in STEM fields. Examples include summer bridge
programs and other co-curricular instruction [60], faculty mentoring [20], living-learning
communities [61], and near-peer mentoring [62]. However, research shows that such pro-
grams are often underutilized by women, BIPOC, and other marginalized populations, leading
to differential academic outcomes [19, 56, 63]. This is in part because BIPOC and first-genera-
tion students are more likely to support family members or work for pay while attending col-
lege [22, 51, 53]. Hurtado et al. [53] document that while ameliorative efforts may help
individuals, students participating in BIPOC-identified programming face social stigma
because these programs do little to alter university cultures that assume White, male, affluent
scientists are the norm. Thus, such programs may become a target for stereotypes from major-
ity-group students, activating stereotype threat in participants [64].
Theoretical and conceptual framework
In sum, the extant literature demonstrates that women, BIPOC, and low-income college stu-
dents face barriers to equitable outcomes with men, White, and affluent students, and these

problems are exacerbated in STEM fields [19, 22, 65]. However, many previous studies focus
on one group at a time, or investigate facets of students’ identities and positions as additive
variables [3]. A critical quantitative and intersectional framework allows us to examine how
individual beliefs (meanings) and institutional practices (policies and programs) affect stu-
dents’ sense of belonging across positions of difference, acknowledging the simultaneity of
race-gender-class identities embedded within inequities [30, 66–72].
Critical quantitative and computational approaches aim to detail and expand engagement
with experiences of marginalized and underrepresented communities. This area of methodo-
logical innovation is a burgeoning subfield in educational research and the social sciences that
offers opportunities to refine our methodological approaches for improving STEM education
[73]. Malik [74] defines critical quantitative and computational approaches as “the use of
quantification and mathematical modeling (e.g., mechanistic, statistical, ‘algorithmic,’ simula-
tion) within a critical and constructivist framework that understands quantification and
modeling as social, situated, contingent, and ‘productive’ (often towards harm), not natural,
universal, inevitable, or neutral” (p. 12). This orientation for quantitative research aligns with
intersectionality’s emphasis that individuals cannot add or subtract facets of their lives [75];
therefore, an additive approach misses important nuances of human experiences. Hence, both
sense of belonging and intersectional differences are difficult to assess quantitatively. Qualita-
tive interviews can explore meaning and processes, but may lack generalizability. Mixed meth-
ods research promises to alleviate some of these concerns [76].
Intersectionality theory, rooted in critical race theory (CRT) and Black feminist theory,
may be used as a guiding framework and set of analytical tools [2, 77–79]. In the realm of
higher education, an intersectional framework pushes researchers to forefront how students of
all backgrounds existing within the same institutional context nevertheless experience varying
levels of privilege or marginalization; that is, students’ social location influences their collegiate
experiences over and above academic ability and personal preferences [64]. In other words,
one’s position at the intersection of race/ethnicity, gender, and income (among other statuses)
remains important for determining whether an individual experiences advantage or oppres-
sion when navigating social systems, structures and institutions [79]. Moreover, an intersec-
tional framework forefronts the complexity of social location, inviting researchers to consider
how simultaneously experienced identities inflect experiences differently depending on con-
text. For example, a student may experience belonging and advantage in pursuing a STEM
major along one axis (e.g., identifying as a man), and experience disconnection and/or sys-
temic oppression along other axes (e.g., identifying as Black and low-income).
We employ a mixed-methods approach, informed by critical quantitative methods and an
intersectional framework, utilizing in-depth interviews to further contextualize data collected
at an institution we refer to as “Meadow State University (MSU),” a large public research uni-
versity. Survey analyses often cannot tell us why or how student experiences are linked to their
sense of belonging. Thus, prior explorations of college belonging provide limited understand-
ing of these complex, intersecting factors. We use MSU’s institutional survey data to explore
the potential for intersectional differences in students’ reported college satisfaction and sense
of belonging. Then, we analyze in-depth interviews conducted separately, at the same univer-
sity, and during similar time periods as the survey data, to further contextualize the intersec-
tional variation suggested by survey results. Our mixed-methods approach contributes
insights into how and why students’ background, individual choices, and institutional prac-
tices concurrently—and intersectionally—influence their ability to form a sense of belonging
on campus.
Utilizing survey data assessing student satisfaction and sense of belonging, and in-depth
interviews exploring aspects of students’ sense of belonging in greater detail, we build on this

literature to investigate: (1) How satisfaction varies by student identity, including race/ethnic-
ity, gender, and their intersections; (2) How students’ satisfaction is influenced by academic,
social and campus belonging, and other student characteristics such as working for pay, first-
generation, and transfer status; (3) How college major (STEM/non-STEM) influences associa-
tions between race/ethnicity, gender, their intersections, and satisfaction; and (4) What quali-
tative interviews reveal about why satisfaction, factors influential for satisfaction, and sense of
belonging vary by race/ethnicity, gender, family income and associated factors, major, and
their intersections. Answering these questions advances our understanding of how, when,
why, and for whom sense of belonging develops at MSU, a PWI that has publicly affirmed its
commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity. Our findings point toward avenues for reduc-
ing campus inequalities with structural changes aimed at increasing equity in students’
belongingness.
Materials and methods
Our mixed-methods approach begins with quantitatively exploring variations in three mea-
sures that correspond to students’ perceptions of their institution’s cultivation of academic,
social, and campus belonging, and a reflective consequence of sense of belonging—students’
willingness to return to the same university (a proximate measure for student satisfaction)—
using survey data collected at Meadow State, a large, public research university with a STEM
emphasis. Then, we analyze in-depth interviews conducted between 2014–2016 with students
attending the same institution to explore how and why satisfaction and sense of belonging
vary, accounting for students’ complex experiences.
Our quantitative analyses use two academic years of data from the National Survey of Stu-
dent Engagement (NSSE), an institutional survey asking students to evaluate their undergrad-
uate institution. When developing our interview schedule, we obtained a list of variables
included in MSU’s fielding of the NSSE survey. In this way, we were able to ascertain the extent
to which NSSE’s survey questions would align with our interview questions, and to make sure
that we asked certain questions that we knew we wanted to delve into in greater depth than
surveys allow (e.g., “willing to return,” faculty interaction, and student income and employ-
ment questions). However, due to the long process involved in obtaining permission to use
MSU’s institutional data for this study, we had no knowledge of the NSSE survey results prior
to conducting interviews.
The NSSE data we use represent MSU students enrolled during the 2013–2014 (n = 1,864),
and 2016–2017 (n = 1,528) academic years. Pooled together, these data allow for an intersec-
tional examination across academic majors given the small sample sizes of BIPOC students
each survey year. Pooled data contained 3,392 undergraduate students, with 2,272 (44.34%)
enrolled in STEM majors and 2,852 (55.66%) in non-STEM majors. Our institutional data
limit us to utilizing the college students’ major is housed in to indicate STEM or non-STEM
affiliation. For example, both Psychology and Biology majors are defined as STEM by NSF,
and they are also defined as such in our data because at MSU, both are housed in the College
of Science. Despite the limitations of this organizational structure of degree programs at MSU
shaping our data, we were able to capture a majority of STEM degree programs aligned with
the following NSF STEM areas: (1) agricultural sciences; (2) biological sciences; (3) earth,
atmospheric, and ocean sciences; (4) mathematics and computer sciences; (5) physical sci-
ences; (6) social sciences; (7) engineering; and (8) health sciences.
The racial/ethnic composition of the sample was: 339 (9.83%) Asian or Pacific Islander
(Asian/API), 89 (2.58%) Black, 93 (2.70%) Latine, 2,560 (74.20%) White, 369 (10.70%) Multi-
racial/ethnic or other race. Unfortunately, we are unable to examine Native American student

experiences specifically, due to institutional aggregation of these students within the “multira-
cial/ethnic or other race” category available to researchers. We note that choosing a pan-ethnic
term for people of Caribbean, Central and South American descent with Spanish-speaking
heritage is politically and linguistically fraught. “Latinx” is common in academia, but just 3%
of those it is intended to describe self-identify this way [80], and it is criticized as an Angliciza-
tion unpronounceable in Spanish. We use “Latine,” a gender-inclusive term increasingly used
in Spanish-speaking lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) communities
[81].
The gender breakdown was nearly evenly split with 1,752 (51.47%) women and 1,652
(48.53%) men. NSSE did not provide a question to distinguish transgender and cisgender
prior to 2013, nor does it include nonbinary options. Data for 2014 and 2017 included too few
valid cases of non-binary students to be specifically examined in our analysis. Our qualitative
interview protocol allowed students to freely identify their gender, but only one individual ini-
tially identified as trans/nonbinary. This individual later changed their designation, leaving us
with no respondents who identified outside traditional binary categories.
Student composition by race and gender was: 1,331 (39.24%) White women, 1,207
(35.58%) White men, 152 (4.48%) Asian/API women, 186 (5.48%) Asian/API men, 47 (1.39%)
Black women, 39 (1.15%) Black men, 46 (1.36%) Latine women, 47 (1.39%) Latine men, 170
(5.01%) Multiracial/multiethnic or “other race” (Multiracial/other-race) women, and 167
(4.92%) Multiracial/other-race men. Lastly, to maximize all possible available data for model
estimates and the small sample sizes of students when considering race/ethnicity, gender, and
academic major, we used multiple imputation with chained equations (MICE) to impute 10
sets of missing values to adjust for missing data on our four dependent variables and the aca-
demic and social background control measures before estimating our models [82, 83]. Missing
data ranged from less than one percent to slightly above two percent for variables included in
our models.
Measures
Institutional cultivation of sense of belonging.
Although the NSSE did not include
explicit measures of students’ sense of belonging until 2020, previous administrations of the
survey included a series of measures that arguably reflect students’ perceptions of how well
their university cultivated academic, social, and community (campus) belonging, following
Nunn’s [7] conception. Students were asked how much MSU emphasizes “providing support
to help students succeed academically;” and “using learning support services (tutoring services,
writing center, etc.)” (1 = very little; 2 = some; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). These two mea-
sures formed a proximate measure for how well MSU cultivates academic belonging among
students (α = .7663). Students were also asked how much MSU emphasizes “providing support
for your overall well-being (recreation, health care, counseling, etc.);” “helping you manage
your non-academic responsibilities (work, family, etc.);” and “providing opportunities to be
involved socially.” These measures formed our proximate measure for how well MSU culti-
vates social belonging among students (α = .7944). Lastly, students were asked how much MSU
emphasizes “attending events that address important social, economic, and political issues;”
“encouraging contact among students from different backgrounds (social, racial/ethnic, reli-
gious, etc.);” and “attending campus activities and events (performing arts, athletic events,
etc.)” These three measures formed our proximate measure for how well MSU cultivates cam-
pus belonging among students (α = .7678). Table 1 provides a summary of the scale construc-
tion of the three forms of sense of belonging and model fit of the confirmatory factor analysis,
which provided a moderately strong fit with the proximate measures available in the NSSE.

Willingness to return.
Students were asked whether, if they could start their undergradu-
ate studies over, would they attend the same institution again (1 = definitely no; 4 = definitely
yes). Referring to it as “willingness to return,” this measure captures institutional satisfaction
as defined previously, which we use as an indicator of intersectional differences in student
experiences [36–38]. The extent to which students of differing backgrounds, identities, and
majors express a willingness to return signals whether the institution is perceived as supportive
and inclusive. Disparities in cultivating satisfaction, in relation to belonging, reveal for whom
the institution falls short. However, students could also interpret the question as a cost/benefit
analysis. Thus, relying solely on survey items could lead us to miss important nuances of
belongingness. Our mixed methods approach mobilizes in-depth interviews to address this
limitation, allowing us to explore whether students’ willingness to return is predicated on feel-
ings of belongingness not captured by available survey questions.
Academic and other social background characteristics.
We included a group of aca-
demic and other social background characteristics of students as control measures for explor-
ing inter and intracategorical intersectionality among students. Among the academic
characteristics, we included academic year (1 = freshman; 2 = sophomore; 3 = junior;
4 = senior). Unclassified students were omitted (n = 54). Self-reported average grades were
also included. While the NSSE uses an 8-point scale ranging from “1” equaling “C- or lower”
and “8” equaling “A”, we decided to rescale the measure to better align with a 4.0 grading scale
where each unit increased by .3 (1.7 = C- or lower; 4.0 = A). We also included two measures of
students’ work experience on- and off-campus (each measured: 1 = 0 hours; 8 = 30+ hours). In
some analyses, we examine STEM (1) and non-STEM majors (0) separately.

In relation to the other social background characteristics of students beyond their ethnora-
cial and gender categories (each operationalized as dichotomous identifying variables), we
identified if students transferred to the university (1 = yes; 0 = no). Available measures associ-
ated with family income included self-reported first-generation status, defined as when neither
parent or guardian has a BA/BS degree (1 = yes; 0 = no), and students’ average weekly hours
worked for pay on and/or off campus (1 = 0 hours; 8 = 30+ hours). Lastly, we control for the
year the NSSE was administered (1 = 2013–14; 2 = 2016–17). Table 2 reports descriptive statis-
tics for the MSU NSSE sample.
Quantitative methods
Our analyses of NSSE data seek to answer our first three research questions, documenting vari-
ation in students’ perceptions of how well MSU cultivates the three forms of sense of belonging
identified by Nunn [7] and their willingness to return to MSU. We conducted linear regres-
sions with fixed effects to examine changes in students’ perceptions of their institution’s culti-
vation of sense of belonging and their willingness to return to MSU. Similar to Lo´pez et al.
[69], we utilize a dual strategy to explore students’ intersectional social locations, which are
associated categories of race/ethnicity, gender, and academic major that represent “categories
of experience in a given sociohistorical and political economic context” such as on college
campuses and society more broadly [55]. First, we estimated models for each of our four
dependent variables that included students’ race/ethnicity, gender, and academic major sepa-
rately and with interaction effects between these three key features of students’ social locations.

White students, women, and non-STEM majors were reference groups in these models. Next,
we estimated fixed effects models that were fully saturated, meaning the models included all
combinations of ethnoracial and gender groupings embedded within students’ academic pro-
gramming (20 social locations) in our analyses, with white men in STEM programs as the ref-
erence group given their historical privileging at the university. Through this analytic
approach, we can explore inter- and intracategorical intersectionality or the between-group
differences in students’ perception of MSU’s cultivation of academic, social, and campus
belonging among students and their willingness to return to MSU, and further examine the
qualitative differences between students in STEM and non-STEM majors [69, 77].
Qualitative methods
In 2014, we began recruiting MSU undergraduate students for a longitudinal study of intersec-
tional differences in college-to-career trajectories. We utilized email, flyers, in-person presen-
tations across majors, and word of mouth. To increase BIPOC participation, we contacted
organizations such as the Black Student Union and “Latines in STEM.” Our recruitment and
longitudinal interview protocols necessitated collecting and utilizing identifying information
about individual participants. We obtained research protocol and ethics approval from Vir-
ginia Tech’s Human Research Protection Program for all of our research activities that
involved human subjects. We note that students may have been included in both NSSE survey
waves if they chose to respond, and may have also been included in our qualitative sample.
However, we are unable to identify if the same student was included in multiple samples
because of the deidentification of the quantitative data required by the institution in providing
access to the authors.
By July 2014, we had amassed a pool of over 400 potential interviewees, using an initial
short survey that collected basic demographic information, as well as willingness to complete
multiple waves of interviews over five years. Along with a team of six undergraduate and grad-
uate research assistants, the first author developed an interview schedule (see supplemental
materials). We piloted the interview schedule with each other, as well as with nine undergradu-
ate volunteers with a variety of majors and racial/ethnic identities, who were previously uncon-
nected to our research team.
After obtaining external funding (see funding statement), our team transitioned to selecting
interviewees from among the general pool of volunteers. We were selective, in order to create
a corpus of interviewees that were diverse in terms of gender, racial/ethnic identity, and major.
The first author was responsible for training graduate and undergraduate students to conduct,
code and analyze interviews, based on her years of experience with interviews as a primary
research method. Interviewers used the same interview schedule with every respondent,
though we utilized a semi-structured format that allowed for variation in follow-up questions
based on interviewee responses. For example, not all interviewees reported facing “challenges”
because of their identities, but every respondent who did face a challenge was invited to tell us
about those experiences in detail. All first-wave interviews used in this study were coded twice,
with the second coder providing a “check” on the first. All disagreements in coding resulted in
a meeting to reconcile coding; coders discussed any differences, sometimes with the first
author as well, until agreement was reached.
Our efforts resulted in 113 first-wave interviews, completed between 2014–2016. Respon-
dents included 54 men (47.8%) and 59 women (52.2%). Forty (35.4%) identified as BIPOC,
and 55 (55.6%) were STEM majors. Our sample also included two STEM/STEM double
majors, and five STEM/Non-STEM double majors. Our team, including graduate and under-
graduate researchers, spent several months considering the size and composition of the sample

to include for the qualitative portion of the present article. It is important to note that our goal
in including qualitative interviews is not to be able to generalize to the overall population of
MSU students, but to contribute in-depth analysis that is purposeful, theoretically driven, and
that complements our quantitative analyses. Following Patton [84], our team utilized the logic
of theory-driven purposeful sampling to select 37 “information-rich cases for study in depth”
(p. 168).
In selecting cases, we sought representation among four ethnoracial identities: White,
Black, Asian/API, and Latine. In choosing which cases to include in order to offer in-depth
comparisons, we (a) selected among those respondents who provided information-rich inter-
views (some interviewees were not as forthcoming); (b) oversampled groups that remain
underrepresented at MSU so that we could explore experiences of those existing at the inter-
sections of marginalized racial/ethnic-gender identities while (c) slightly oversampling STEM
majors among marginalized groups, to be able to investigate whether and how different com-
binations of intersecting identities reflect sense of belonging differently for students pursuing
STEM and non-STEM majors, a key goal of the present article. We note areas for future
research with this corpus of interview data—including exploring subsequent waves of inter-
views—in our conclusion.
Among these 37 information-rich cases, twenty identified as men (54.1%), 17 as women
(45.9%). Eight (21.6%) identified as White, 12 (32.4%) as Black, 4 (10.8%) as Latine, 12 (32.4%)
as Asian/API, and one as multiracial. Interviewees also estimated their family’s income range,
and reported the highest degree attained by each parent or guardian. Based on direct reports
of parents’ and guardians’ earnings, as well as observed patterns in qualitative responses—
including whether respondents self-identified as struggling or “sacrificing” to afford MSU
and/or living in its comparatively high-cost college town—we report these as “low-income”
(<$50,000; 19%) and “middle/high-income” (>$50,000; 81%). Over half were STEM majors
(22; 59.5%), reflecting its predominance at MSU. Table 3 compares the study samples and the
MSU population as it was in the 2014–2015 academic year.
Interviews were semi-structured, and ranged in length from 30 minutes to over two hours.
Interview length varied based on respondents’ experiences (some had more to relate than oth-
ers) as well as individual verbosity. Transcripts of our 37 illustrative cases were coded using
Dedoose software. Utilizing an iterative process and multiple coders to enhance reliability, we
completed two rounds of coding. After each interview had been coded twice by two different
coders, the two coders met to discuss their findings collaboratively, and to “reconcile” any dif-
ferences in their application of the codebook, a process inspired by the “negotiated agreement”
approach [85]. Any remaining disagreements were resolved via group discussions with the
first author. In this way, we negotiated 100% agreement on all coding decisions.
Open coding resulted in preliminary, descriptive coding exploring the scope of students’
experiences. For example, we coded for “educational decisions,” developing a typology of
motivations (“economic returns;” “financial cost”) from interviewee responses. Second-round
coding included a more focused examination in order to develop thematic codes related to our
sensitizing concepts, a term referring to theory-based ideas that provide focus and direction for
qualitative analyses [86]. Examples of sensitizing concepts for these analyses include “Net-
working” and “Underrepresented Identity Benefits/Challenges.” Our analysis proceeded with
attention to themes salient to students’ satisfaction and sense of belonging; how interactions
with faculty, academic characteristics, and other social factors relate to belongingness; and evi-
dence of intersectional differences therein. For example, thematic codes such as “getting to
know professors” helped us identify intersectional differences in how, when, and why students
interact with or avoid professors.

In analyzing our 37 illustrative cases, we sought to answer our final research question for
the present article: why satisfaction, and factors influential for satisfaction, vary by race/ethnic-
ity, gender, income, major, and their intersections. Ultimately, students’ responses to our
open-ended “willingness to return” interview question indicated sense of belonging as a promi-
nent explanation.
Results
Quantitative analyses
Table 4 presents the fixed effects models for students’ perceptions of institutional cultivation of
the three forms of sense of belonging based on Nunn’s [7] conceptualization. We additionally
conceptualize “willingness to return” to MSU if students could “do it all over again” as an
extended consequence of sense of belonging and satisfaction with the college experience.
These models utilize the first component of our dual modeling strategy based on Lo´pez et al.
[69] of incorporating interaction effects between students’ race/ethnicity, gender, and aca-
demic major (STEM or Non-STEM) to identify baseline intersectional differences in percep-
tions of institutional cultivation of sense of belonging. To facilitate conversations about
magnitude of impact, we report the average marginal effects.
When considering students’ race, gender, and academic major separately, men were less
willing to return to MSU compared to women (AME = -.218, p<. 05). Moreover, men held
lower levels of academic belonging (AME = -.188, p<. 001), social belonging (AME = -.156,

dents also had less willingness to return to MSU compared to white students (AME = -.156,

belonging than non-STEM majors (b = .131, p< .05).
Turning to the interaction terms included in the models, we find a somewhat mixed pattern
of results among racially minoritized students. Few interaction terms across race/ethnicity,
gender, and academic major reached statistical significance in our initial models. When con-
sidering the intersection of race and gender, Black men reported lower perceptions of social
belonging on campus (AME = -.485, p<. 05). Asian/API men who were STEM majors
reported higher levels of willingness to return to MSU (AME = .556, p<. 01). However, multi-
racial/other race men in STEM reported lower perceptions of social belonging on campus
(AME = -.445, p < .05). These initial findings provide a complicated picture of how social

location—including students’ race/ethnicity, gender, and academic major—relates to three
forms of belongingness and willingness to return to MSU.
The second component of our quantitative analyses tests fully saturated fixed effects mod-
els. Table 5 considers students’ responses with regard to 20 intersected social locations. Here,
we seek to uncover students’ inter- and intracategorical intersectional experiences, as com-
pared to White men in STEM majors, the group historically most privileged at MSU. As with
the models presented in the previous table, our findings in Table 5 suggests a mixture of posi-
tive and negative trends in terms of MSU’s cultivation of sense of belonging, and students’ will-
ingness to return to MSU.
In comparison to White men in STEM, White women in STEM majors (AME = .286, p<
.001), held more positive views of MSU’s cultivation of academic belonging. Considering
MSU’s cultivation of social belonging, again, White women in STEM (AME = .218, p< .01)
held more positive views compared to White men in STEM majors. Asian/API women in

Asian/API women in non-STEM majors (AME = .451, p< .05) and Multiracial/other-race
men in non-STEM majors (AME = .499, p< .05) held more positive views of MSU’s cultiva-
tion of campus belonging as compared to White men in STEM. Turning to students’ willing-
ness to return, Latine women in STEM majors (AME = .440, p< .05) were more willing to
return compared to White men in STEM majors. However, Asian/API men in non-STEM
majors (AME = -.646, p< .001) and Black women in STEM majors (AME = -.684, p< .01)
reported less willingness to return compared to White men in STEM majors.
We were secondarily interested in directly exploring associations between our set of control
measures—academic year, grades, being first in one’s family to attend college, being a transfer
student, working for pay, and survey year—and the three forms of belonging as well as willing-
ness to return. We find that as students’ time on campus increases, as measured by their aca-
demic year, all three forms of belonging decrease. Higher grades are associated with higher
academic, social, and campus belonging. As expected, being a transfer student was associated
with decreased social and campus belonging. Interestingly, academic and social belonging, as
well as willingness to return, appear to be decreasing over time, based on NSSE survey year.
Students who worked more hours on campus for pay corresponded to increased social and
campus belonging, and increased willingness to return, but did not relate to academic belong-
ing. Similar findings did not exist for hours worked at off-campus jobs. How such work may
relate to sense of belonging and degree pathway obstacles such as certain majors having hidden
costs, and these other connections are presented in this article’s supplementary information
(S1 Table), and helped inform our interpretations of the findings we explore in greater depth
in our qualitative analyses.
Though small numbers of respondents in some of the race-gender-major groupings war-
rant cautious interpretations, it is important to recall these reported patterns represent mean-
ingful differences in student experiences. Our dual modeling strategy adds nuance to our
understanding of how much students felt MSU cultivated academic, social, and campus
belonging. The mixed results from our analyses suggest potential gaps remaining between
institutions’ attempts to cultivate belonging, and students’ reflections on whether, in the end,
they felt fully satisfied with their college educational experience.
Rather than assume additive interpretations, our analyses highlight how students are differ-
entially experiencing STEM and non-STEM programs at MSU in ways that demonstrate a
complex picture of inter- and intracategorical intersectionality [69, 77]. Lastly, the similarity in
the size of F and the interclass correlation (ρ) for the models suggest the dual modeling strategy
of complimentary interaction terms and full saturation with students’ social locations uncovers
experiences hidden beneath the traditional multiplicative approach to quantitative intersec-
tionality analyses [69, 87].
Qualitative analyses
We use 37 in-depth interviews drawn from the same institution as our survey data to triangu-
late these patterns, exploring how and why observed quantitative patterns might occur. We uti-
lize interviewees’ stories to investigate the relationships between gender, ethnoracial identity,
major, and satisfaction. Then, we examine how student identity and major further inflect expe-
riential factors suggested by prior research and our survey data to affect willingness to return:
faculty interactions, institutional support, and working for pay. Our dual aims are to add (1)
depth to our quantitative examination of group differences and influential social factors; and,
(2) nuance by exploring factors not available in NSSE, such as a direct measure of family
income. We find that intersectional differences in sense of belonging—or lack thereof—was a
prominent explanation for respondents’ willingness to return.

Qualitative insights: Willingness to return
Eight interviewees (21.6%) would not return to MSU if they could choose again. Some patterns
identified in survey data surfaced in interviews, such as a greater number of men (n = 5)
unwilling to return than women (n = 3). Non-STEM majors were in the majority among inter-
viewees unwilling to return (n = 5: two Black men; one Black woman; and two White men,
one of whom was first-generation). All STEM majors unwilling to return identified as BIPOC
(n = 3: one Black woman, also a transfer student; one Asian woman; and one Latine man).
Non-STEM majors unwilling to return perceived less prestige in, and support for, non-
STEM subjects at MSU. Ryan, a low-income White man and first-generation scholar who
switched from Engineering to English, felt stigmatized: “I have been embarrassed to tell people
what my major is.” English suited Ryan’s career goals, but he lamented that “people often
assume that like, ‘Oh you shifted to English because you were too stupid to do the other thing,’
or because, like, you are impractical or lazy.” Kyle, a Black English major, wished he had
instead attended MSU’s rival institution, because of its superior liberal arts reputation. The ste-
reotype of the “unemployable” English major is widespread in the U.S., so similar sentiments
may be found at other universities. However, MSU’s reputation as a STEM-centric institution,
where Engineering is held in particularly high regard, likely exacerbated these respondents’
negative feelings about their majors. Unwillingness to return under these circumstances may
be particularly elevated among those who, like Ryan, switch from a high- to a low-prestige
major.
A commonality among non-STEM BIPOC unwillingness to return was MSU’s lack of
diversity, which inhibited social and campus belonging. Hayden, a Black Sociology major,
reported that the “White-centric focus” at MSU caused problems. He resented that “the way
people tend to go about it is to try to make it the responsibility of the Black student to fix the
problems with race on this campus. I came here to get a degree; who came here to fix the prob-
lems on this campus? I don’t get paid for that!” Non-STEM BIPOC students experienced inter-
locking disadvantages when they felt coerced to help “fix” hostile environments.
Though no STEM majors reported pressure to “fix the problems with race” at MSU, and
were happier with the level of academic support, STEM programs did not protect marginalized
students from regularly experiencing microaggressions. Rachel, a Black woman in Engineer-
ing, participated in several programs supporting Black students. Yet, when asked what it takes
to “fit in” at MSU, she paused for a long time before answering, “being White? I don’t know,
having straight hair?” She recounted how some White peers enviously pointed out her “perma-
nent tan,” while others denigrated her “gross” haircare routine. Rachel straightened her hair
one semester to fit in more, because, as she put it, “I hate being the center of attention, and my
hair made me feel like that. Along with my skin color.” She tired of her “uncomfortable” MSU
life: “It does affect me personally. . .I’m trying to find myself and be true to who I am, but at
the same time it really takes a toll on your self-confidence.” Rachel thought, “nobody would
find me attractive.” Rachel disavowed gender as influencing her experiences, saying “I have no
problems being a woman. . .I am Black first, then a woman;” yet, the microaggressions she
reported mainly concerned beauty standards that are simultaneously gendered and racialized.
Rachel appreciated MSU’s academic opportunities but regretted not choosing a college with a
more diverse student population. As she put it:
Rachel: I feel better if either a) people were all Black, or b) people were all different. There is
not enough differences here for me to feel comfortable. I would rather it just be all different.
I feel better when it’s all different.
Interviewer: So if there is a more diverse population here you will feel much better?

Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel wanted a more diverse student body so that she could be herself, without having to
explain or call attention to herself—something she felt was impossible at MSU.
Sharlyne, a Black woman, was satisfied with her Nutrition major, but not the “forced com-
munity” of MSU’s social environment. Asked what it takes to “fit in,” she responded: “I would
say if somebody wanted to fit in at Meadow State, they’d be White. They’d have money.
They’d probably be in a sorority or fraternity. . .I wouldn’t even say it has anything to do with
academic major.” Like Rachel, Sharlyne participated in programs for “minorities” in STEM,
but this did not engender social and campus belongingness:
It’s hard being a minority here, especially my freshman year, sometimes I just felt like I was
the only one. . .I came from a very diverse place, so, like being submerged into an old way, a
culture that has. . .roots from 1870 or whatever—it can be really challenging figuring out
your place at a school like this.
Black students constituted ~3% of undergraduates, inviting stereotype threat. As Sharlyne
said, “some people might think, you know, African American students are here because [of]
affirmative action.” Sharlyne reported, “I don’t really think about being female here. I think
more about race. . .your race can kinda like shape your experience.” Though Rachel and Shar-
lyne disavowed gender as salient to their belongingness, we observe intersectional differences
in the negative experiences Black students reported. In 2016, few organizations at MSU
highlighted intersectional identities. MSU’s comparatively highly visible Black-identified
resources (e.g., the Black Student Union) could explain why students like Sharlyne viewed
their ethnoracial identity as the primary force shaping their college experiences. Black stu-
dents’ stories add depth to our survey finding that Black women in STEM majors were less
willing to return, despite non-significant findings for this group on belongingness measures.
The experiences of STEM-focused Black women unwilling to return demonstrate how a hostile
social context decreased their social and campus belonging to such an extent that satisfaction
with academics could not make up the difference.
Qualitative insights: Academic belonging
Supporting survey results that academic belonging is important to students when evaluating
their college experiences, and that it varies intersectionally, interviews reveal the nuanced ways
students assessed factors that influence these measures. We identify intersectional differences
in academic belonging as a prominent explanation for willingness to return.
Interviewees mentioned enjoying their majors more following advanced classes, which
facilitated increased skills and “getting to know” professors. Mary, a Latine woman in Engi-
neering, rarely attended office hours her first year. But sophomore year, interactions with pro-
fessors facilitated belongingness: “I’m really starting to get to know [my professors] and it’s
like I go to them if I ever need help and I feel like that’s had a really positive effect on me.”
Mary bemoaned her “bad GPA” (2.6 grade point average), but satisfaction with professors, the
support she received, and the skills she gained balanced out dissatisfaction with her grades. In
contrast, Neil, a White man in Finance, found his classes disappointing and low-quality. Not
having to work hard, nor feeling he gained useful skills in his classes, motivated Neil’s regret in
having chosen MSU.
Addie, a first-generation student from Vietnam pursuing a degree in the College of Busi-
ness, was satisfied with MSU’s quality and reputation, but reported that “you have to get [a]

good relationship with your professor” because networking was crucial for success. However,
she saw herself at a disadvantage: “I feel like, students like me, I don’t get help from professor
[s] that much. . .getting attention from people is hard, and, in my major, it’s very important to
make the professors and companies to know you, remember you. So I think it’s a challenge. . .”
An international and transfer student, Addie found professors less likely to reach out to some-
one like her; “It’s up to myself.” Rachel, the Black Engineering major profiled previously,
reported similar feelings of stereotype threat: “my teacher in math is White. . .I feel like some-
times [professors] might think I’m automatically stupid.” Rachel attributed her fears to MSU’s
“social environment:” specifically, the lack of faculty and student diversity raised prospects for
unequal academic treatment.
Antonio, a Latine man in Engineering, experienced such negative faculty interactions that
he considered transferring. Antonio received the typical advice to attend professors’ office
hours to establish rapport. During one visit, however, the professor greeted Antonio, then
audibly complained to a colleague, “Ugh, he’s always here!” Antonio was shocked; “I was just
like, ooh, I, I just felt like that hurt.” Thinking he could not simply leave, Antonio went
through the motions: “I asked her a question or whatever, got over the question and then I
kinda just picked my stuff up and left.” Afterward, he changed concentrations within Engi-
neering, and abandoned office hours: “I just stopped going. . .I completely blocked it off.”
Despite his heavy involvement in organizations for Latine engineers, he cited the need for bet-
ter community and support systems. Antonio worried he would lack strong letters of recom-
mendation for graduate school because his relationships with professors were
underdeveloped. If he could choose again, Antonio would pick a university “that is a little bit
more, I guess, open to Hispanics.” Antonio’s negative faculty interactions outweighed his
major and skill-development satisfaction, leading to worries about his post-college trajectory.
Previous research recommends undergraduate research as a means of building academic
belongingness [60]; yet, interviews suggest that family income status may influence low-
income students’ ability to participate. Undergraduate research opportunities were typically
unpaid, and undertaken only when internships—often highly competitive—could not be
secured. Though little research provides comparisons of internship relevance and availability
across majors, it is clear that internships are expected, competitive and highly valued in some
majors (e.g., Engineering, Business) and less common/less expected in others (e.g., Biology,
English). At least one study found that for majors in Engineering and Business, it is more
likely—as compared to social science and humanities majors—that a successfully completed
internship will lead to a job offer [88]. Mary, the Latine Engineering major, applied for intern-
ships “left and right,” but companies “turned me away because my GPA was bad.” Mary found
an unpaid research position through a faculty connection: “I’m kind of like one of his favorite
students.” Mary was excited about doing research, but disappointed not to have applied intern-
ship experience, which Engineering respondents universally valued highly. Mary acknowl-
edged that having her parents’ financial support made accepting a research opportunity
feasible. Ricky, an Asian-American, first-generation Food Science major, dismissed his
research experience; he had not “scratched the surface enough. . .need some job experience.
‘Cause even though I’ve done research, I need to do stuff outside [in] the field.” Ricky did not
think research directly applied to his plans: working for a food industry conglomerate, while
saving to open a restaurant. Mary’s and Ricky’s experiences suggest that undergraduate
research, though a re´sume´-builder, may be inaccessible for low-income students, and was less
valued as a career-builder than paid internships.
The experiences of Addie, Rachel, Mary and Antonio demonstrate why interactions with
faculty and perceptions of academic support mattered for students’ satisfaction with MSU,
implicating academic belongingness as an underlying explanation. Addie, Rachel and Antonio

felt disregarded by faculty due to one or more marginalized identities. Mary’s connection with
a professor garnered an unpaid research opportunity, which her family income status made
feasible. Importantly, MSU has the power to address these limitations in ways that could boost
students’ satisfaction and sense of belonging. For example, MSU could train faculty to improve
their skills in working with underrepresented and marginalized students, and fully fund
undergraduate research experiences. Absent such interventions, we found that race/ethnicity,
family income, and other student characteristics influenced faculty interactions and academic
experiences in complex ways, offering additional reasons why simultaneous membership in
intersecting identity categories differentially affected sense of belonging at MSU.
Qualitative insights: Working for pay and family income status
Interviews explored students’ paid work and family income status, following prior research
finding that paid work can significantly slow down students’ progress. Seventeen interviewees
(46%) worked for pay; seven total (19%) reported family incomes of $50,000 or less. The 17
employed students included all eight of those unwilling to return to MSU. In-depth question-
ing on this topic supplements survey findings suggesting positive connections between paid
work hours and social and campus belonging, as well as willingness to return, but no relation-
ship between this measure and academic belonging. Survey results did not find significant rela-
tionships between first-gen status, belongingness and willingness to return. NSSE does not ask
participants to report family income, a limitation we also supplement with interviews; it is
worth noting that four—half—of the eight interviewees unwilling to return to MSU reported
family incomes of $50,000 or less. Interviewees broadly agreed (68%) that family income is a
“factor increasing chances of success,” influencing “doing well in college” and “getting ahead
in society.” Qualitatively examining family income and paid work experiences offers insight
into how and why these factors may differentially influence belongingness and willingness to
return, particularly among STEM majors.
Luis, Kyle, and Hayden, all Black men, related struggles due to low-income status, and their
experiences implicated intersectional inequalities. Luis (Business), slowed down: “I took a
semester off to work. . .I realized, crap, I can’t pay for this semester, I got to take this off.” Kyle
(English) had financial difficulties despite his scholarship, loans, and paid work: “I actually had
to cancel my meal plan ‘cause we didn’t have enough money.” Hayden (Sociology) reported
that “good” unpaid internships were “interested in me,” but inaccessible:
[Income matters] just in terms of being able to afford to do things that others can’t. Like
when I brought up the unpaid internship thing; some of these opportunities will look great
on my re´sume´. . .one I saw was an unpaid internship for the White House. . .Even if they
look great on our resume´s, and open doors for us, and help us make connections, we [can’t]
—there’s no way for us to take that opportunity.
Hayden additionally felt unwelcome in some social spaces:
. . .there are things [activities] that before I’m even thinking of joining, I have to think
about, first of all, let’s say the class [status] of who’s being there. Like, I’ll want to know if
my experiences would let me fit into that group, and sometimes I feel like with different
groups they look at me and they just think that I wouldn’t want to be there, because of either
my race or my [class] background; I never know what it is. (italics added)
Hayden could not know definitively whether his intersecting identities affected his social
belongingness, but sensed “something” inhibiting his inclusion in student organizations and

other social spaces. Hayden’s reciprocal hesitancy led him to question whether his experiences
would “let me fit into that group;” that is, if others would perceive a low-income Black man as
a valued contributor.
Interviewees also linked family income to the ability to access high-impact educational
practices. Shane, a White man in Engineering, spoke dismissively of a classmate’s expensive
study abroad, deeming it academically frivolous. Yet, Shane reflected, perhaps “the study
abroad, like, ‘looks good’ [on a re´sume´]. . .having the ability to go out there and explore a little
bit more. . .having money not be an issue.” Thus, family income status led to differential access
to signature college experiences that “look good” to others, enriching belongingness.
Moreover, interviewees connected family income security, and associated freedom from
the necessity for paid work, to lower stress, which also facilitated success. Hannah, a Multiracial
woman in Engineering, expressed confidence: “[H]onestly, I know I’m going to make it
through. I mean, I don’t really worry too much. . .I’m fortunate ‘cause my parents are paying
for my school. . . So, I just gotta make sure I pass all my classes.” None of the six STEM-focused
women interviewees with jobs worked more than 12 hours per week. Three specifically men-
tioned valuing “flexible” jobs, where they could cut back whenever school became “crazy
busy.” Women interviewees who were STEM majors agreed: STEM success was incompatible
with high employment hours.
Survey results showed no relationship between academic belonging and time spent working
for pay. Yet, interviews with STEM-focused women suggest there may be intersectional
nuance within this non-finding. That is, dominant groups in STEM appear to set the terms of
STEM major engagement in ways that foment intersectional oppression, creating barriers for
women and low-income students that differentially affect their satisfaction and sense of
belonging. While Kyle worried about his scholarship’s GPA requirement and Luis had to take
a semester off, Hannah’s parents paid tuition and rent, reducing stress and making work
optional. Thus, income security helped compensate for factors otherwise negatively associated
with willingness to return and belongingness, such as being a BIPOC student in STEM.
Hannah’s serenity sharply contrasts the stress inflecting the experiences of low-income stu-
dents like Kyle and Luis. Hayden noted, “people who are financially well-off. . .that gives you
greater agency. . .like we all come here, we all make mistakes, but some of us can’t come back
from those mistakes like others can.” Higher-income status smoothed academic pathways,
facilitated high-impact educational practices, reduced stress, and eased demanding STEM
schedules. Low-income status inhibited academic, co-curricular, and social opportunities in a
context that provided higher-income students with opportunities to utilize monetary resources
to gain exclusive access to valued opportunities, such as unpaid internships and study abroad.
Institutions have the power to enact policies and practices that can reduce the extent to which
students’ economic resources matter for building academic, social and community belonging.
For example, institutions can provide student scholarships for internships and study abroad,
or directly fund co-curricular activities. To enhance social belonging, MSU could provide
additional education and resources for student organizations, potentially addressing the
“unwelcome” atmosphere Hayden reported. MSU lacked such supports; thus, the limitations
experienced by underrepresented students were exacerbated at the intersections of marginal-
ized identities, differentially affecting students’ sense of belonging.
Discussion
Our mixed methods approach illuminates a range of challenges affecting undergraduates’
sense of belonging, as measured by expressed desire to return to MSU if given a chance to “do
it all over again.” Our findings affirm prior research that when belongingness is missing,

students express less satisfaction with their college experiences [6]. Furthermore, as predicted
based on prior research findings, the extent to which these factors affected outcomes addition-
ally varies by identity and other background factors [39–41]. That is, differences at the intersec-
tions of race/ethnicity, gender, family income and associated factors indeed matter for
students’ willingness to return. Moreover, we found that willingness to return is influenced by
major, with significant differences for STEM versus non-STEM majors, as well as nuanced dif-
ferences when disaggregating by academic, social, and campus belonging. Taken together, our
findings lend support to prior findings that (1) sense of belonging and satisfaction matter
when it comes to students gaining benefits from their college experiences [6, 30, 31]; (2) sense
of belonging is a complex construct, and results vary by the three types of belonging (academic,
social, and community) identified by Nunn [7]; and that, in some cases, (3) women, BIPOC,
and low-income students face greater barriers to developing a strong sense of belonging in col-
lege as compared with men, White, and wealthy students, and these issues are often exacer-
bated among students whose identities have been marginalized in STEM majors [19, 22, 65].
Our critical quantitative approach also reveals new findings, including some unexpected
results that highlight the complexity—and necessity—of utilizing a critical and intersectional
framework to explore college belongingness and satisfaction [30, 66–72, 77, 79]. We show how
intersectional oppression matters for student experiences using a modeling strategy that
uncovered inter- and intracategorical differences by race, gender, and academic major. Our
study’s methods contribute depth and nuance, extending beyond previously reported quantita-
tive patterns [e.g., 32, 35] to provide qualitative insight on the experiences of marginalized stu-
dents, demonstrating how and why sense of belonging varied intersectionally. Our ability to
untangle the three areas of belonging that Nunn [7] identifies—academic, social and commu-
nity—revealed how belongingness in only one area (e.g., academic) was often insufficient for
students with intersecting marginalized identities to persist in STEM majors and to express a
willingness to return, providing a counterpoint to some previous survey-based results [23, 59].
We uncover significant gaps remaining in the goal of providing equitable outcomes at a public
U.S. research university.
When assessing student satisfaction and sense of belonging, context of intersectional experi-
ences mattered. Although STEM majors reported higher academic belonging and satisfaction
per their willingness to return, this finding did not hold across all groups majoring in STEM.
For example, women were more willing to return to MSU and expressed higher levels of sense
of belonging. A complex array of positive and negative findings existed for ethnoracially minor-
itized students for each form of sense of belonging. One group that highlights these complex
findings are Asian and Pacific Islander students and their experiences of social belonging at
MSU. While our interaction term models found Asian and Pacific Islander students had lower
levels of willingness to return than their White peers, Asian and Pacific Islander students in
STEM held higher levels of willingness to return to MSU. The need to be attentive to the partic-
ularities of intersectional positions and experiences on campus are also exemplified by the lower
levels of social belonging for Black men—regardless of academic major—and multiracial/other-
race men in STEM degree programs. Among the social location models, across all ethnoracial
student groups, when exploring the intersectional experiences and social locations by gender
and academic major, no singular narrative fits our findings concerning student sense of belong-
ing and willingness to return. These complex results add nuance to patterns found in some pre-
vious sense of belonging literature [cf. 6], and highlight the contributions of our mixed methods
approach that attends to intersectional oppression. Our survey data provide the broader con-
tours of campus inequalities, while qualitative inquiries plumb the depths of how and why eth-
noracial-gender intersections mattered to students’ opportunity to build and activate a sense of
belonging on campus—most poignantly, in interviews with Black men and women.

Qualitative results revealed important components of academic belonging included faculty-
student interactions, perceptions of academic support, and a privileging of STEM degree pro-
grams and students over non-STEM students and their degree programs at MSU. Our analyses
align with some previous findings, suggesting faculty responsiveness, mentoring and high
impact practices like internships play an important role, particularly in STEM programs [20,
62, 89]. Perceiving better interactions with faculty increased belongingness. Interviews linked
feeling ignored or disrespected by faculty with decreased belongingness, in some cases leading
students to change majors. Thus, complicating previous belongingness research, we find that
academic pathways among underrepresented and marginalized students may be linked to
whether students gain a sense of community inclusiveness, including in their major [7]. Con-
versely, feeling that MSU supported students’ growth and development, including job-related
skills acquisition, increased satisfaction and belongingness. Taken together, our quantitative
and qualitative findings demonstrate that, particularly for BIPOC students and those subject
to intersectional oppression due to multiple marginalized identities, satisfaction with academ-
ics did not always outweigh deficiencies in other areas of campus life shaping belongingness.
Our quantitative results suggest that willingness to return to MSU increases as paid work
hours increase in on-campus jobs. This positive trend differs from prior research on working
for pay while pursuing higher education [41]. Though this finding warrants future investiga-
tion, we suggest it may speak to how students are building connections with other peers work-
ing on campus alongside them, which then translates to increasing their sense of belonging.
This somewhat unexpected finding is concerning because university costs continue to outpace
inflation, despite many universities eagerly recruiting first-generation and low-income stu-
dents. Despite uneven connections between each form of sense of belonging and willingness to
return to MSU, first-generation status, and paid work hours in survey results, our interviews
confirmed family income and associated factors as influential for students’ college trajectories,
with STEM-focused women most adamant that working for pay more than 12 hours per week
was incompatible with STEM success.
Furthermore, income and ethnoracial identity intersected to additionally shape belonging-
ness. Our interviews with low-income Black men signal multiple ways intersections of margin-
alized identities link to more troubling experiences, less opportunity to participate in co-
curricular activities, and a weaker sense of belonging. Universities serious about transforming
the structure of opportunity and the cultural contours shaping belonging among BIPOC, low-
income and first-generation students, particularly in STEM majors, should initiate visible,
institution-level efforts to protect students from microaggressions and stereotyping, and sup-
port broad access to high-impact educational experiences such as study abroad regardless of
income status. These efforts must include the ability to cultivate belonging with students’ inter-
sectional experiences in mind, but also allow for holding the institution accountable for prog-
ress toward creating a more equitable, inclusive, and just campus [20, 79]. Our findings
provide insight into college students’ complex lives in ways that may not come to light when
utilizing singular methodological approaches. These complexities require mixed methodologi-
cal approaches to uncover how and why institutional initiatives and experiences can lead to
simultaneously differing student outcomes.
Conclusion
Limitations
Using available NSSE data hindered a full exploration of the intersectional differences in stu-
dents’ satisfaction and sense of belonging. Smaller samples for some groups limited our ability
to construct models that were race-gender specific (i.e., Black women, Latine men). Though

we utilized some critical quantitative methodological approaches, additional data could assist
with elucidating how satisfaction and sense of belonging differences reflect students’ complex
intersectional experiences, particularly in STEM [19, 68, 69]. Moreover, while the age of the
data utilized may be of concern, the recent global pandemic exacerbated previous findings that
intersectional inequalities persist on college campuses and impact the degree pathways of stu-
dents [90, 91]. Future research using more recent data from MSU can identify the extent to
which students’ sense of belonging has changed, for whom it changed intersectionally, and
how college campuses have adjusted their support for students from different social locations
as we continue to understand the impact of the global pandemic on student degree pursuits
and academic success. Additionally, while our modeling approach used marginal effects for
comparisons across multiple groups, other modeling strategies can assist with clarifying and
adjusting for multiple comparisons exploring intersectional differences among students.
Data limitations prevented us from fully examining differences among STEM majors.
Women and BIPOC remain underrepresented in PEMC majors (Physics, Engineering, Mathe-
matics, Computer Science), yet parity or a gap reversal has occurred in STEM fields like Biol-
ogy and Psychology [44]. MSU’s concerns for protection of human subjects required
institutional data on STEM-identified majors to be grouped by college. Thus, our results
group students across science-focused colleges (e.g., biology, physics, math, and psychology
are all housed in the same college at MSU) which might explain why some ethnoracial-gender
outcomes observed in Table 4 (full sample) exhibit different patterns in Table 5 (STEM and
non-STEM subsamples).
Our only quantitative measures related to family income were first-generation status and
paid work hours in on- and off-campus jobs, limiting our ability to comprehensively explore
the expected relationship between income status, satisfaction, sense of belonging, and other
important social factors. Pairing our critical quantitative modeling strategy with interviews
conducted on the same campus allowed us to further explore intersectional differences in fam-
ily income and associated factors. Future work will examine longitudinal interview data gath-
ered from the full sample of 113 MSU students. Each higher education institution has some
unique features, but we expect that quantitative results concerning inequalities in patterns of
satisfaction and belonging we uncovered at MSU are likely present at other research-focused,
public institutions in the U.S. We utilized NSSE surveys that were fielded at MSU, but since
NSSE’s validated survey questions are given in the same way at many other universities, we
would anticipate some generalizability of our findings from this portion of our study. Our
qualitative interview findings are less likely to be broadly generalizable. However, it is impor-
tant to note that, in collecting interview data, generalizability was not our goal; rather, we
sought to investigate the particularities of MSU’s context in greater depth.
Future directions
While our quantitative analyses highlight differences in students’ sense of belonging across the
three forms based on measures of institutional support, such belonging and willingness to
return can be shaped by faculty interactions and research experiences that were not explored
in our initial models. Previous research documents that underrepresented and marginalized
students face barriers to research opportunities, or fail to fully benefit from them because of
discriminatory experiences [51, 56, 58, 92]. In our interviews, students noted how they navi-
gated research opportunities and preferred paid internships. Their experiences and stated pref-
erences further complicate our understanding of the barriers and opportunities students
encounter when pursuing STEM pathways; in particular, BIPOC interviewees’ responses sug-
gested microaggressions and other negative faculty interactions can lead to disengagement.

That is, micro-level experiences reveal the contours of macro-level marginalization and benign
neglect. Further research will explore these possible connections both in subsequent interview
waves and available survey data. Our findings here suggest that universities should assess the
distribution and funding of internships and research opportunities, in conjunction with the
quality of faculty-student interactions across student groups. Targeted funding for students—
and training for faculty—could be strategic options for eliminating avenues that allow well-
resourced students to accumulate advantages. Structural changes such as these may help
reduce disparities and increase belongingness.
We know that policies designed to encourage achievement and persistence have varied
effects, inflected by student identity and major [19, 63]. Future research must continue to
examine these factors intersectionally, using mixed methods and longitudinal data to follow
students’ progress over time. Our results here indicate the need for future institutional and
quantitative research to afford the possibility of disaggregating broad panethnic categories
such as “Asian/API” and “Latine” in order to be able to suggest targeted and specific interven-
tions. Disaggregated data may better reveal how differential histories, immigration policies,
and experiences of intersectional oppression are driving the remaining inequities we observe
[93].
Examining college pathways at the intersection of two or more structures illuminates how
systems of oppression are linked [66], thereby revealing the (re)production of beliefs, attitudes,
and behaviors that are simultaneously gendered, racialized, and classed [70]. Structural
changes are required to end practices that—consciously or not—support intersectional oppres-
sion by favoring White, upper-income men as the “default” STEM students in the U.S. Our
research supports a growing body of evidence that institutions must actively build models of
inclusion for underrepresented and marginalized groups to address inequitable and unjust
practices, providing transformative mentoring and educational guidance that attends to inter-
sectional oppression, in order to effectively support the next generation of women and BIPOC
scholars [18, 20, 24, 58, 79]. Our mixed methods approach reveals how and why multiple fac-
tors related to college satisfaction influence students’ sense of belonging. Our interviewees had
strong opinions about MSU’s social ecology, which BIPOC students viewed as White-centric.
A thorough examination of MSU’s social life is out of scope here, but our future work will
address this topic in greater depth. Academic leaders would do well to pay closer attention to
how satisfaction with academic supports may not outweigh dissatisfaction with faculty, inter-
personal relations, and/or access to high-impact experiences, maintaining inequalities in
belongingness along intersections of race/ethnicity, gender, income and major.
