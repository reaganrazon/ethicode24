Abstract
Background: The number of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy studies in K-12 education
has recently increased, with most research focusing on primary and secondary education
contexts. Little research focuses on AI literacy programs in early childhood education.
Objectives: The aim of this mixed-methods study is to examine the feasibility of an
AI literacy program called “AI4KG” and explore how it might affect kindergarteners'
perceptions of robots and attitudes towards engineering and science.
Methods: A total of 26 child–parent dyads recruited from a Hong Kong kindergarten
were involved in this study, consisting of 26 children (Mage = 4 years, SD = 0.28) and
their parents. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through surveys and
interviews designed to explore children's perceptions of robots and attitudes towards
engineering and science, and parents' perceptions of the AI4KG intervention.
Results: It is found that children have increased their perceptions of robots after the
AI literacy program, but the AI4KG curriculum had no significant effects on kinder-
garten children's engineering and science attitudes. Most parents (22 out of 26)
agreed that their children's AI knowledge, AI skills, and AI attitudes have been
enhanced after learning through the AI4KG curriculum.
Conclusions: This study suggests that the AI4KG curriculum is potentially effective in
promoting early AI literacy and favourable attitudes towards the technology, but
further research is needed to develop age-appropriate measures and assess its long-
term impact on children's education and career paths.

INTRODUCTION
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a technology that mimics human intelli-
gence to perform cognitive tasks, including learning and problem solv-
ing based on sets of rules and environment (Wang, 2019). As AI
transforms the way we communicate, work, and live with each other
and with machines, AI literacy becomes a crucial skillset for the future
(Long & Magerko, 2020). AI literacy education frameworks have been
developed for primary, secondary, and higher education to enhance AI
literacy (Kong et al., 2021; Su & Yang, 2022; 2023; Su et al., 2023).

However, few studies have focused on AI literacy programs in early
childhood
education
(Su
&
Zhong,
2022;
Williams,
Park,
&
Breazeal, 2019; Williams, Park, Oh, & Breazeal, 2019). This could be
due to the difficulty for young children to use existing AI learning plat-
forms, such as Teachable Machine, independently. To address this
issue, parents can be involved as learning partners to facilitate their
children” learning about AI. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap
and advance social equality and sustainable development goals by
developing an AI education program for early childhood education
and evaluating its feasibility in terms of promoting young children's
perceptions of robots and attitudes towards engineering and science.

AI literacy for K-12
An increasing number of educational programs have been developed
with the aim of imparting the fundamental concepts of AI to students
in primary and secondary school education (K-12) (UNESCO, 2022).
For example, Rodríguez-García et al. (2020) designed a program called
“LearningML” to teach students about programming applications
based on a subfield of AI—Machine Learning. In terms of grounding
these AI education programs, there are several frameworks of refer-
ence. The AI for K-12 initiative has developed guidelines for AI educa-
tion in K-12 schools, with the emphasis on five big ideas in AI:
(1) perception, (2) representation and reasoning, (3) learning, (4) natural
interaction, and (5) societal impact (See more details in http://ai4k12.
org/). Wong et al. (2020) also proposed a three-dimensional AI literacy
framework, covering AI concepts (e.g., machine learning, deep learn-
ing, and neural networks), AI applications (e.g., speech recognition,
robotics, and smart assistants), and AI ethics. Likewise, Lao (2020) pro-
posed a Machine Learning (ML) Education Framework to highlight
three categories of AI learning, including knowledge (e.g., general
knowledge about ML methods, bias, and societal implications), skills
(e.g., ML problem scoping, ML project planning, ML artefact creation),
and attitudes (interest, self-efficacy, persistence, and identity). Based
on a systematic review (Ng et al., 2021), these AI education programs
can enhance K-12 students' AI literacy through four main aspects,
including (1) knowing the fundamentals of AI and AI applications;
(2) applying AI in various contexts; (3) evaluating and creating AI; and
(4) ethical considerations related to AI. While AI can bring many bene-
fits, it can also have negative effects on children. For example, expo-
sure to AI algorithms that perpetuate biases can lead to children
internalizing and perpetuating those biases (Melsion et al., 2021).
Additionally, excessive screen time and dependence on technology
can negatively impact children's social and emotional development
(Radesky & Christakis, 2016). Furthermore, AI can raise ethical con-
cerns, such as privacy and security issues, that may be difficult for
young children to understand and navigate (Ali et al., 2019). These
potential negative effects of AI on children should be taken into
account when designing and implementing AI literacy programs. How-
ever, due to the distinction of developmental characteristics and
learning needs, these AI education programs for K-12 cannot be
simply used in the context of early childhood education. It remains
rarely known whether AI curriculum for pre-K children can bring ben-
efits to their learning and development.

Introducing AI to young children: why
and how
Yang (2022) summarizes that there are three strong reasons for
introducing AI to young children. First and foremost, AI literacy should
be learned as early as possible. This aligns with the movement of
democratizing AI for education (Druga et al., 2019), as well as the
emphasis
placed
on
developing
digital
citizenship
(Lauricella
et al., 2020). Notably, AI can bring adverse effects on children if it is
used in an unethical way. For instance, algorithmic bias or bias in the
data input can cause racial and sexual discrimination. To ensure that
children will not be impacted by unfair AI systems, they need to
develop their AI literacy, which covers knowledge about the bias that
may be caused by AI (Yang, 2022). To achieve this goal, the research
literature has suggested to promote age-appropriate learning activities
that can teach fundamentals of AI to preschoolers. These learning
activities can use intelligent agents such as robots (Williams, Park, &
Breazeal, 2019; Williams, Park, Oh, & Breazeal, 2019) and machine
learning platforms (Lane, 2021), and be supported with effective
pedagogies such as project approach (Lane, 2021), storytelling
(Kandlhofer et al., 2016), and embodied instruction (Yang, 2022). This
is more important given that AI is exacerbating digital divide in the
society. Children from less advantaged backgrounds tend to have less
quality
exposure
to
digital
learning
experiences
(Su,
Yang,
&
Zhong, 2022; Su, Zhong, & Ng, 2022), and they may have difficulties
in forming a strong foundation in understanding AI. Druga et al.
(2019), for example, investigated how children reported their concep-
tions of AI and found that children from low socioeconomic back-
grounds would have difficulty advancing in the use of AI devices due
to their lack of experience in interacting with AI. Hence, there exists
an imperative to advance the dissemination of AI education to all chil-
dren, particularly to those in their early childhood, with the aim of
minimizing the digital divide.
Furthermore, teaching AI to preschoolers can promote their inte-
grated learning. And only with teachers' guidance, preschoolers can
effectively acquire AI knowledge and skills. Druga et al. (2017; 2018)
found that children lacked the means to understand the AI knowledge
underlying AI-related devices such as smart assistants and social
robots, if without the guidance from adults. Children's learning about
AI can further increase their reasoning skills (Vartiainen et al., 2020)
and adaptive behaviours (Prentzas, 2013). With a clear understanding
of AI, children have the capability to form a more nuanced under-
standing about digital technologies. Su and Yang (2022) have
conducted a scoping review on AI in early childhood education and
shown that AI can improve children's conceptions about AI, machine
learning, computer science, and robotics.
The third reason to promote AI education in the early years is
linked to the nature of children's learning. AI devices as a daily
object can appeal to children's curiosity and interests, thus lying the

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
foundation for further learning. An early exposure to AI-related edu-
cation can encourage children to develop creative inquiry skills
through their playful learning about AI with teachers and peers
(Kewalramani et al., 2021). More importantly, AI education can help
children form a healthy appreciation for the power and limitations of
AI technologies (Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019; Williams, Park,
Oh, & Breazeal, 2019). As a long-term agenda, promoting AI in early
childhood education will allow the sustainable development of
humankind through the development of a digital inclusion ecosystem.
However, there is a scarcity of research on how to effectively inte-
grate AI literacy into early childhood curriculum.
In terms of how to engage young children in learning AI, there are
some interesting studies exploring the pedagogical strategies and
tools. For instance, Kandlhofer et al. (2016) designed 10 learning
activities to teach various AI topics to children using stories, inquiry
projects, and educational robots. Sakulkueakulsuk et al. (2018) used
AI challenges to engage children in the game-based projects of
designing machine-learning models. Williams, Park, and Breazeal
(2019) and Williams, Park, Oh, and Breazeal (2019) developed a
robotic platform called “PopBot” and used it in a curriculum of
teaching children about knowledge-based systems, supervised
machine learning, and generative music AI. Vartiainen et al. (2020),
instead, used Google's Teachable Machine as an intelligent agent
to interact with young children, who have learned to reason about
machine learning systems. Kewalramani et al. (2021) used AI-
interfaced toys to promote meaningful interactions between chil-
dren and these smart toys, which further promoted children's crea-
tive inquiry skills. Some of the latest research showed that AI
literacy in ECE programs can enhance children's comprehension of
basic AI concepts (e.g., Lin et al., 2009; Su & Yang, 2023; Williams,
Park, & Breazeal, 2019; Williams, Park, Oh, & Breazeal, 2019), with
some researchers recommending that children should learn AI
(e.g., Su & Zhong, 2022; Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019; Williams,
Park, Oh, & Breazeal, 2019). These intervention studies also show
that AI education programs or curricula can engage children in
acquiring AI literacy and develop their high-order thinking skills.
However, all these studies were conducted in Western countries,
without any evidence from the non-Western contexts such as
China.

Effects of AI literacy education on children's
perceptions of robots and engineering and science
attitudes
AI literacy education, which is the education and training of individ-
uals in the field of AI, can help children develop a positive attitude
towards the technology and its potential applications. Studies have
shown that children who receive AI literacy education have a more
positive view of robots. For instance, a study by Williams, Park, and
Breazeal (2019) found that children who participated in AI literacy
education programs were more likely to view robots as helpful and
intelligent. Furthermore, they were more likely to believe that robots
could be used in a variety of different settings, such as in homes,
schools, and hospitals.
AI literacy education can also help children develop a positive
attitude towards engineering and science. For example, a study by
Zhang et al. (2022) found that middle-school students who partici-
pated in AI literacy education programs were more likely to view engi-
neering (AI) as a desirable and rewarding career choice. They were
also more likely to view science as important and relevant to their
lives. This is important, as children who have positive attitudes
towards engineering and science are more likely to pursue careers in
these fields, which can help to address the shortage of skilled workers
in these areas. The age of the students and specific content of the
AI/robotics curriculum may influence whether such education trans-
lates to changes in attitudes or career interests.
In summary, while studies on the effects of AI literacy education
are limited, available research suggests that the nature of children's
experiences with AI and robots can influence their views of the tech-
nology and that AI/robotics curricula may potentially boost attitudes
towards engineering, depending on the age group and program con-
tent. More studies are needed to generalize findings across ages, cul-
tures, and types of AI education. Researchers should also explore how
attitudes or perceptions might translate to eventual choices or behav-
iours around AI and technical fields. AI literacy is a growing area of
interest, and better understanding its impacts could help maximize
benefits and minimize risks as it becomes more prevalent in educa-
tion. Additionally, future research should consider the implications of
AI literacy education, such as which types of AI education are most
beneficial for different age groups, and which types of AI education
are most likely to lead to positive attitudes and behaviours related to
AI and engineering.

The present study
As argued by Yang (2022) in his conceptual article, AI curriculum for
young children should at least address three fundamental challenges
to early childhood education, including (1) what to learn—the learning
content, (2) how to learn—the learning approaches, and (3) why to
learn—the expected learning outcomes. Since AI education can inte-
grate various disciplines of knowledge to enrich children's learning in
this digital era, we aim to know how AI curriculum can be used to
intentionally support children's learning and development, especially
in a non-Western context. This will help contribute to the learning
resources and curricula for early childhood education in non-Western
countries, since most of the existing programs are designed for K-12
students in the Western countries. Besides evaluating the feasibility
of AI literacy education on promoting children's learning using quanti-
tative data, we also obtained parental perceptions to better under-
stand the learning experience of children. The following Research
Questions (RQs) guided this design-based study:
RQ1. Did the AI learning activities develop child partic-
ipants' perceptions of robots?

METHODS
2.1
|
Participants
An AI4KG education program was launched in a Hong Kong kinder-
garten. A total of 52 participants (26 parents and their 26 children
aged between 3 and 5) participated in the study. Among the 26 chil-
dren, 15 were girls and 11 were boys (Table 1). The average age of
the participants was 4 years old, and the Standard Deviation (SD) was
0.28 years. None of the children had any prior experience with AI in
kindergarten or outside of kindergarten. The AI4KG curriculum was
delivered to both children and parents, with each learning activity last-
ing approximately 35 min. Due to young children's limited attention
skills, we did not engage children in a lesson longer than 35 min.
However, because the activity was provided to child–parent dyads,
parents were encouraged to continue doing AI activities with their
children at home.

The intervention: the AI4KG curriculum
The AI4KG curriculum is implemented using the three AI learning
tools and a curriculum designed and revised by researchers. The three
learning tools are Teachable Machine (https://teachablemachine.
withgoogle.com/), AI for Oceans (https://studio.code.org/s/oceans/
lessons/1/levels/2), and Quick, Draw! (https://quickdraw.withgoogle.
com/), which enable children to learn basic machine learning concepts
and knowledge. Teachable Machine, AI for Oceans, and Quick, Draw!
are three learning tools used in the AI4KG curriculum to enable pre-
schoolers to learn basic machine learning concepts and knowledge.
Teachable Machine is a web-based tool developed by Google, which
allows users to create their own machine learning models by training
them with images, sounds, and poses. AI for Oceans is a game-based
learning tool developed by Code.org, which teaches children about
the role of AI in protecting marine life. Quick, Draw! is a web-based
game developed by Google, which challenges players to draw differ-
ent objects while an AI model guesses what the object is.
Figure 1 demonstrates the model of using intelligent agents such
as Teachable Machine to teach machine learning to young children
(Yang, 2022). The AI4KG curriculum is designed to introduce basic AI
concepts and knowledge to preschoolers through different learning
activities, such as play-based and story-based learning. Each of the
eight lessons in the curriculum focuses on a specific learning objective,
such as understanding the principles of AI inference or learning about
the functions of AI robots. The research team has developed an AI
story (see more details in Lesson 3 below) for children, which facili-
tates children's understanding of AI robots (their functions and types).
Also, the program uses a project-based learning method to help
children better understand the basic machine learning knowledge. For
example, in Lesson 6, children learn about the classification of recy-
cling garbage and how to create and train a machine-learning model
to classify different recycling garbage images. In Lesson 7, children
learn about the classification of different poses and create a machine-
learning model based on poses. More details about the activities of
this AI4KG program can be found below.
2.2.1
|
Lesson 1: The learning journey of little
AI robot
Lesson 1 introduced basic AI concepts in a playful way. Two AI activi-
ties were designed, which aimed to allow children to learn the princi-
ples of AI inference based on key data/features and identify different
types of robots used in daily life. Play-based learning method was
adopted to help children better understand the basic AI knowledge.
At the end of Lesson 1, children answered the questions “what
did you learn in this class? and “describe the activities in your own
words”.
2.2.2
|
Lesson 2: Is AI always right?
Lesson 2 introduced situations that AI robots may not have encoun-
tered to illustrate that robots must continue to learn and improve
through two learning activities. Children were asked to draw their
own AI robots and give a sharing on their work at the end of
Lesson 2.
2.2.3
|
Lesson 3: Story activity: My Robot Robbie
In Lesson 3, children listened to an AI robot story to understand the
functions of AI robots and how AI robots can help us. And also design
their own AI robots.
Children were asked to answer the following questions—“Amy
found that Robbie was motionless, what should she do?”, “Why is the

bring to Amy?”, “Do you like this cute robot?”, “Do you want to have
it? Why?”
Story pictures were placed on the desk to help children under-
stand the different uses and functions of intelligent robots and guide
them to design symbols that represent robot functions. Children then
took part in a role-playing activity to experience the fun of intelligent
robot functions. First, children played the roles of intelligent robots
Robbie and Amy and acted out the story together. Second, children
were encouraged to design their own dialogues and actions in the per-
formance to guide intelligent robots to interact with people in an
interesting way.
2.2.4
|
Lesson 4: AI for oceans
Lesson 4 introduced basic machine learning knowledge to children
through
playing
the
“AI
for
Oceans”
game.
In
this
activity,
children could differentiate fish from garbage, understand what
should be found in the ocean, and that human input is required as AI
robots are not able to classify objects themselves. All children will be
given a certificate issued by CODE at the end of the activity.
Children also answered the questions “what did you learn in this
class? and “do you like to play this game using the AI for
oceans tool?”
2.2.5
|
Lesson 5: Quick, Draw!
Lesson 5 introduced children to machine learning concepts and
their current limitations through games. Children discussed the
following questions—“what did you learn in this class?”, “do you
like to play this game using the AI for oceans tool?”, and “how
many
correct
guesses
did
AI
make
regarding
the
pictures
you drew?”
2.2.6
|
Lesson 6: Teachable machine (images)
Lesson 6 introduced the classification of recycling garbage, ways of
creating and training a machine learning model. Children will under-
stand how to teach a model to classify different recycling garbage
images in this activity. A project-based learning method was used to
help
children
better
understand
the
basic
machine
learning
knowledge.
2.2.7
|
Lesson 7: Teachable machine (poses)
Lesson 7 introduced the classification of different poses and provided
children with an opportunity to create a machine learning model
based on poses.
Children answered the questions “what did you learn in this
class?” and “do you like to play this game using the AI for
oceans tool?”
2.2.8
|
Lesson 8: Summary
Lesson 8 summarized all learning modules and invited children to
share their ideas about AI4KG intervention. For example, children
talked about their favourite activities.
2.3
|
Instruments
Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through surveys and
interviews designed to explore children's perceptions of robots, engi-
neering and science attitudes, and parents' perceptions of AI4KG
intervention. Prior to conducting the child assessment, the research
team provided training to the research assistants (RAs) and subse-
quently, the first author and RAs read the assessment questions aloud

the child's response to each question.
2.3.1
|
Perceptions of robots questionnaire
The robot perception questionnaire was adopted from Williams,
Park, & Breazeal, 2019; Williams, Park, Oh, & Breazeal, 2019. This
study used pre- and post-tests to assess children's perceptions of
robots. The robot perception questionnaire included five questions
(pre- and post-tests), such as “Do you agree that robots should follow
rules or are you neutral about this?”. Druga et al. (2017) and Park
et al. (2017) have piloted and validated this questionnaire in their
research with children aged 3–10 years.
2.3.2
|
Engineering and science attitudes
assessment
Sullivan's (Sullivan, 2016) study provided the basis for the engineering
and science attitudes assessment, which was originally developed as
the “Engineering and Science Attitudes Assessment” by Cunningham
and Lachapelle (2010) as part of the Engineering is Elementary (EiE)
program. The assessment has been found to be reliable, with a
Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.798, by the EiE team who developed
it (Cunningham & Lachapelle, 2010). This study used pre-and post-
tests to assess children's engineering and science attitudes. For exam-
ple, the question “Would you like to become an engineer or are you
neutral about this?” was asked. In this study, questions were asked
through the Monster Game (Druga et al., 2017). The research team
initially assessed the children's knowledge of the concept of an “engi-
neer” by asking them if they were familiar with the term, and if so, to
describe the role of an engineer, with many children providing
responses such as “repairing things” which suggests their understand-
ing of the profession. In cases where children expressed unfamiliarity
with the term, the team provided examples of professionals who
could be considered engineers, such as maintenance technicians in
areas like elevator maintenance and those involved in designing and
repairing robots. Additionally, the concept of neutrality was explained
to the children in context of the assessment, wherein they were
provided with an example of a statement, “I like apples,” and the
meaning of neutrality was elucidated to indicate a position that is
neither strongly in favour of, nor opposed to the statement.
2.3.3
|
Parent interviews
The goal of interviewing is ‘to access the perspective of the person
being interviewed’ (Patton, 1990, p. 278). In order to achieve this
goal, the interviews were conversational in tone and consisted of
standardized open-ended questions. Parents were invited to attend
the individual interview after class. All parents/guardians were also
invited for a 15–25-min post-class interview to understand their
perceptions about AI4KG intervention. The following questions were
asked: ‘which AI activity do you and your child enjoy the most?’, ‘which
AI tool do you and your child enjoy playing with the most?’, ‘you and your
children participated in this K2 AI activity. Which parts do you think need
improvement or support?’, ‘after your child participated in the AI4KG
activity, what improvement did they show and what knowledge did they
gain?’, and ‘if the researchers continue to work on AI activities, will you
let your child be involved?’

|
Data analysis
In order to better understand the three research questions, a mixed-
methods approach was used to conduct this research study. The
quantitative instruments include perceptions of robots and engineer-
ing and science attitude surveys. The qualitative instrument includes
interviews with parents to understand their perceptions of the AI4KG
program.
2.4.1
|
Quantitative data analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS. Chi-square was used to
analyse quantitative data.
2.4.2
|
Qualitative data analysis
NVivo was used for qualitative data analysis. The first author and
one RA conducted the interviews and transcribed them. The inter-
view data was coded separately using the codebook. Discussions
were held each time after nine interviews had been coded to ensure
validity.
The first author and one RA analysed the interview data based on
thematic analysis. A thematic analysis method was subsequently
adopted to identify themes from coded segments. According to
Meuser and Nagel (2009), thematic units were examined rather than
the order of the participants' statements. An inter-rater agreement
rate of 0.82 (Cohen's Kappa) was identified in this study, which is
considered as high.

ferent from an even distribution (Table 2). Most kindergarten children
agreed
with
the
statements
“I
am
smarter
than
robots”
(15 children) (χ2 = 9.769, p = 0.008***) and “robots are like toys”
(15 children) (χ2 = 7.000, p = 0.030**). One child said that unlike
humans, robots are toys which cannot think. Half of the children dis-
agreed that robots are like adults (χ2 = 4.692, p = 0.096). Twelve chil-
dren
agreed
that
robots
can
learn
new
things
(χ2 = 7.692,
p = 0.021**). One child recalled an experience of visiting the science
museum and finding out that AI robots can chat with people, which
led to his belief that robots can learn language.
Most children were neutral about whether or not robots follow rules
(χ2 = 0.538, p = 0.764). They explained that robots are like toys, which
do not follow rules. They also thought that robots are not like adults.
More than half of the children believed that they are smarter than robots.

Post-test
Kindergarten children's post-test views on whether or not robots can
learn new things (χ2 = 10.692, p = 0.005***) and are like adults
(χ2 = 8.615, p = 0.013**) significantly changed (Table 3). Most chil-
dren agreed that robots are like adults after they learn AI. Most
children said that they want an AI robot that can chat with them, play
with them, and teach English with them in AI4KG activities. They
wonder if AI robots can do these things, like adults. However, 11 chil-
dren still believed that robots are like toys (χ2 = 0.615, p = 0.433)
after AI4KG intervention. Fourteen children believed that robots
could learn new things (χ2 = 10.692, p = 0.005). In the AI4KG
curriculum, children understand AI has limitations and encounters
new situations it cannot handle. Furthermore, 12 children agreed that
robots follow rules (χ2 = 2.846, p = 0.241). They think that although
robots are like adults, they do not need to cross the road.

Changes in answers: pretest to post-test
To examine changes in children's responses between the pretest and
post-test, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted for each item.
The largest changes were observed in children's perception of
whether or not robots are like adults (χ2 = 8.615, p = 0.013), with
11 children moving from disagree to agree on this statement, as
shown in Table 4. Some of the children, especially those aged 4 years
old, believed that robots are like adults because they can chat and
play with them like their parents. However, some 3-year-old children
thought robots are like toys because they cannot pick them up from
school. The second largest changes were observed in children's opinions
about robots' ability to learn new things (χ2 = 10.692, p = 0.005), with
10 children moving from disagree to agree on this statement after the
AI4KG intervention. During the AI ocean world activity, it was evident
that the AI robot required human input to recognize different objects as it
could not perform the task independently. However, eight children
moved from agree to disagree on this statement as they believed that
robots are like adults who do not need to learn new things.

Pretest
The pre-test results showed that kindergarten children wanted a job
building new things (χ2 = 3.769, p = 0.152), that they know what engi-
neers do (χ2 = 1.462, p = 0.482) and that science is closely related to real
life (χ2 = 0.077, p = 0.962), as shown in Table 5. When being asked the
question “do you want a job building new things?”, 11 children answered
in the affirmative. Some children reported that “I went to the science
museum and saw some interesting robots. I want to build robots to play
with me.” Nine children reported that they know what engineers do
(χ2 = 1.462, p = 0.482). Child Choi said his father is an engineer. How-
ever, children's definitions of what engineers do were very different, rang-
ing from being responsible for home repair to being a train driver. It is
rather surprising that a large number of kindergarten children reported
knowing what engineers do. Nine children reported that science is inextri-
cably related to real life. It may be that STEM education is an integral part
of Hong Kong education and that more kindergartens have conducted
research about STEM in recent years. Only six children agreed that they
would like a job figuring out how things work (χ2 = 1.231, p = 0.540). It
is possible that this question was too hard for children to comprehend.
3.2.2
|
Post-test
In terms of post-test, chi-square analysis showed that most children
reported
wanting
a
job
building
new
things
(χ2 = 22.231,
p = 0.000***). More children knew what engineers do (χ2 = 5.846,
p = 0.054*) and want to be an engineer after AI4KG intervention
(χ2 = 0.538, p = 0.764), as shown in Table 6. When asked to describe
the job of engineers, most children said engineers build AI robots, with
some of them even expressing that they want to build an AI robot on
their own. It can be seen that the AI4KG curriculum increased
children's interest in AI robots.
However, fewer children (from six to five) said that they would
like a job figuring out how things work (χ2 = 2.846, p = 0.241). Some
children mentioned that they did not understand this question since it
was too complex.
3.2.3
|
Changes in answers: pretest to post-test
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test did not reveal any significant differ-
ences between pretest and post-test due to the small sample size of
only 26 children. However, some noticeable changes were observed
in the children's desire to pursue a job that involves building new
things and their understanding of engineers' job duties, as indicated in
Table 7. Although the AI4KG curriculum did not specifically focus on
educating children about what engineers do, the intervention seemed
to have improved their understanding to some extent. However, their
understanding was limited to the misconception that engineers only
build AI robots, which might be the reason why some children claimed
to understand engineers' job nature after the intervention. The most
noticeable change was observed in the children's desire to pursue a
job that involves building new things, with 20 children expressing
interest in doing so after the intervention (only 12 expressed interest
before the intervention). This may be because the AI4KG curriculum
exposed them to AI robots, allowed them to create their own robots,
and taught them about the functions of different robots. Activities
such as storytelling about AI robots playing, chatting, and teaching
English to children could have also sparked their interest in pursuing a
job that involves building new things. However, there were no signifi-
cant differences in children's responses to the five questions before
and after the AI4KG curriculum, as shown by the p-values which were
all above 0.5. Therefore, the AI4KG curriculum did not have any sig-
nificant effects on kindergarten children's engineering and science
attitudes.

Perceptions of parents towards AI4KG
To know parents' perceptions of AI4KG intervention, 26 parents
were invited for a 10- to 15-minute individual interview in
order to gain insights into their perceptions of the AI4KG
intervention.
3.3.1
|
The AI activities children and parents
enjoyed
Several
AI
learning
activities
for
kindergarten
children
and
parents were designed. We asked kindergarten children and
their parents ‘which learning activities you enjoy most?’. Most
kindergarten children and their parents answered they preferred
“AI for Ocean” (13 families), followed by “AI robots' story”
(six families) and “Teachable Machine” (six families), as shown in
Table 8.
Child Ng: I realized that besides being a toy, AI robots
can also help us do different jobs.
Child Ko: I like AI robots' story activity because I want
to have a robot that can play with me.
3.3.2
|
The AI tools children and parents enjoyed
playing with
Three AI learning tools were selected for kindergarten children and
parents, who were asked to explain what their favourite tool was.
Most kindergarten children and their parents indicated that they
preferred “AI for Oceans” (13 families), followed by Quick, Draw!
(11 families), as shown in Table 9.
3.3.3
|
Parents' perceptions about how to improve
the AI4KG program
Parents suggested that three areas be improved: curriculum content,
interaction with children, and Apps (Table 10). Six parents believed that
the curriculum content required improvement since some of the learning
content was either too challenging for K2 children or not interesting
enough. Two parents suggested that the interaction with children needs
improvement. Two parents suggested the improvement of AI learning
tools. Examples of parents' statements can be found in Table 10.

Improved knowledge, skills, and attitudes
after the AI4KG program
Most parents (22 out of 26) agreed that their children's AI knowledge,
AI skills, and AI attitudes have been enhanced after learning the
AI4KG program (Table 11).

Seventeen parents reported that their children deepened their AI
knowledge after AI4KG intervention, as shown in Table 11. AI knowl-
edge includes knowledge about AI robots (eight parents), basic con-
cepts of AI (seven parents), and AI applications (two parents).
Three parents mentioned that their children's understanding of
how AI tools are used has improved through the AI4KG curriculum.
Examples are shown in Table 11.

Course satisfaction
The last question in the interview with parents was “if the researchers
continue to conduct AI activities in kindergarten, will you let your children
attend this project?”. Many parents (22 parents) answered in the
affirmative.
Parent Ng: AI is now an important topic, so I hope my children
can learn more about this.
Parent Cheng: My child likes AI robots so I will let him join the AI
project again.
Parent Choi: My son realized that robots are not only toys, but
also tools that can help us do many things.

DISCUSSION
The popularity of AI literacy programs has been growing recently.
Most AI literacy programs focus on secondary and higher education.
Few research studies examined AI literacy education in early child-
hood contexts (Su & Zhong, 2022). The AI4KG education program,
which is believed to be the first AI literacy program in Hong Kong kin-
dergartens, was launched in this study. A total of 26 child–parent

dyads were involved. This is a mixed-methods study that includes
quantitative (interviews with parents) and qualitative methods (per-
ceptions of robots and engineering and science attitudes assessments)
to explore the feasibility of an AI literacy curriculum in the early child-
hood settings.
In response to RQ1 and RQ2, children's opinions about whether
robots are like adults changed the most drastically (χ2 = 8.615,
p = 0.013), with significantly more children explaining that they
believe robots are similar to adults in the post-test than the pre-test.
This change may be attributed to the AI robot story children read dur-
ing the program, which introduced robots that can not only play with
and cook for children, but also teach them English and pick them up
from school. It is believed that these actions are comparable to those
performed by adults in real life. Likewise, Williams (2018) reported
that the most significant attitudinal change was associated with the
statement “robots are smarter than me.”, with 11 children selecting
their question from disagree, neutral to agree. However, in a study
with older children (fifth grade), children's reported perceptions of
robots tended to over expect the ability of robots (Lin et al., 2009). In
the engineering and science attitudes assessment, the most remark-
able change was found to be related to the statement “I want a job
that involves building new things.”, with 11 children selecting this
statement from disagree, neutral to agree. This shows that children
became
interested
in
AI
robots
and
engineering
after
AI4KG
intervention.
In relation to RQ2, the finding that the AI4KG curriculum had no
significant effects on kindergarten children's overall engineering and
science attitudes is a surprising result. It is possible that the curriculum
was not designed specifically to target these attitudes, and therefore
was not effective in changing them. Alternatively, the curriculum may
have had some impact on children's attitudes, but the measurement
tool used in the study was not sensitive enough to detect these
changes. In a study with older children, students who completed the
Engineering is Elementary (EiE) curriculum showed significantly more
interest in engineering jobs and skills, and reported a higher likelihood
of pursuing an engineering career than students who were not
exposed to the EiE materials (Cunningham & Lachapelle, 2010).
Further research is needed to develop measurements that are age-
sensitive, valid, and reliable for assessing kindergarten children's engi-
neering and science attitudes and to identify potential areas for
improvement in the AI curriculum.
Despite the lack of significant effects on engineering and science
attitudes, the positive feedback from parents is encouraging. The
results of the RQ3 indicated that the AI4KG program was successful
in educating children about AI and fostering favourable attitudes
towards the technology, as 22 out of 26 parents agreed that their chil-
dren's AI knowledge, skills, and attitudes had improved after partici-
pating in the program. This is an important outcome, as it indicates
that the AI4KG curriculum may be an effective tool for promoting
children's AI literacy and preparing them for future careers in STEM
fields, as supported by Yang's (2022) theoretical arguments. Early
exposure to AI concepts and skills can increase children's digital liter-
acy and STEM habits of mind, which would further enhance the digital
equity in education and the society (Yang, 2022). Further research is
needed to confirm these positive effects and to explore the long-term
impact of the AI4KG program on children's education and career
paths.
4.1

Implications for future research
The curriculum design of this study provides concrete examples for
early childhood researchers as a reference. The results of the three
assessment methods could serve as a reference for researchers who
want to evaluate the effectiveness of AI education programs in early
childhood settings. Furthermore, parents' perceptions about AI4KG
intervention often point to some challenges of developing an AI liter-
acy program. An understanding of these impediments could facilitate
the creation of a quality AI literacy program which caters for students'
needs and addresses parents' concerns.
4.2
|
Implications for policymaking
Policymakers should consider incorporating AI literacy courses into
the kindergarten curriculum. Given the complexity of AI knowledge, it
is understandable as to why people take the view that kindergarteners
should not be expected to understand AI concepts. Yet, this study
shows that young children are able to understand basic AI concepts
and deepen their understanding of AI through the AI4KG curriculum.
Not only do they gain AI knowledge, positive changes in their atti-
tudes towards engineering and science, as well as perceptions of AI
robots are also noted. Learning about AI in kindergartens is not a com-
mon practice in Hong Kong as there are currently no policies requiring
the implementation of AI education in ECE contexts. In view of the
findings of this study, changes to the curriculum may need to be made
to nurture a generation that is able to cope with the demands in the
21st century, an era in which the use of technology is ubiquitous.

Limitations
There are several limitations in this study. First, this preliminary study
has a relatively small sample size to evaluate the feasibility of the
AI4KG program. Therefore, the findings regarding the significant
effects of the intervention on children's perceptions and/or attitudes
should be generalized to other populations with caution. Second, this
intervention study did not include a control group for comparing the
effects on children's perceptions and attitudes. In the future, a more
rigorous experimental design employing a comparison group should
be used to verify the findings of this preliminary study, which has
been also argued by Li et al. (2021) for researching and promoting
good practices in early STEM education. Third, the data was only
derived from assessments and interviews. Researchers may consider
conducting observations with children to understand whether their
social and communication skills can be enhanced through an AI

literacy program. Fourth, the study is limited by the fact that the valid-
ity and reliability of the two instruments used to evaluate children's
engineering and science attitudes and robot perceptions need further
evidence. Lastly, only kindergarteners were recruited as participants.
Further research could be conducted to examine the effects of AI lit-
eracy programs on the AI literacy of both kindergarteners and lower
primary students. While the AI4KG curriculum is designed for pre-
schoolers, it is important to note that each child's learning capabilities
may differ. The suitability of the AI4KG curriculum for preschoolers
may depend on their individual learning abilities and interests. How-
ever, the use of play-based and story-based learning strategies, as well
as project-based learning, can make it more engaging and accessible
for preschoolers.
