ABSTRACT
Although the chemical enterprise has provided numerous contributions to humanity, unintended
consequences contribute to a disproportionate exposure of hazardous chemicals to certain
populations based on race and socioeconomic status. Integrating concepts of social and
environmental justice within chemistry curriculum provides an educational framework to help
mitigate these impacts by training the next generation of chemists with justice-centered and
green chemistry principles to guide their future work. Green and sustainable chemistry
technologies can contribute to social equity and environmental justice. However, equity and
social justice have only recently become a signiﬁcant part of the green chemistry conversation.
This article summarizes how the authors have explored issues of equity and environmental
justice with the green and sustainable chemistry community. It oﬀers a toolbox for college and
university instructors containing foundational language, research, and idea-generation that can
be used to strengthen the transition of a traditional chemistry curriculum toward a justice-
centered one.

Introduction
The American Chemical Society’s (ACS) vision (1) focuses
on ‘[i]mproving people’s lives through the transforming
power of chemistry.’ Chemistry has inarguably provided
numerous contributions to humanity; however, it has
come with a history of unintended consequences of
chemical impacts on human health and the environment
(2–4) including planetary-level impacts on atmospheric
processes and climate (5). In some cases, these have con-
tributed to a disproportionate exposure to hazardous
chemicals in vulnerable populations (children, women,
communities of color, and low socioeconomic commu-
nities) (6–11) and warrants discussion around ethics
and responsibility of the chemical enterprise to reduce

these burdens. For example, in low- and middle-income
countries, environmental pollution is a leading cause of
mortality and morbidity (12) and is associated with ill-
nesses such as diabetes (13–15), metabolic syndrome
(16), cardiovascular disease (17–19), and hypertension
(20) among many others. In other cases, naturally-occur-
ring and human-made chemicals have impacted access
to clean air, food, and water globally such as Flint, MI
lead water poisonings (21, 22), lead exposure in inner
city housing (23); higher BPA levels in the blood of indi-
viduals using emergency food assistance due to higher
BPA in donated food bank items (9); jet fuel exposure
in the air surrounding air force bases (24); and other
impacts. Attending to principles of social and environ-
mental justice within chemistry curriculum provides a
framework to reduce these impacts and ensures that
the next generation of chemists hold justice-centered
principles and actions as a steadfast aspect of their
future work. Green chemistry principles can also guide
scientists and policy-makers in making evidenced-
based decisions in how we design, make, use, and
dispose of chemicals and chemical products.
Exploring issues of equity and environmental
justice with the green and sustainable
chemistry community
Only recently has equity and social justice become a sig-
niﬁcant part of the green chemistry conversation. While
the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry do shift accountabil-
ity toward environmental impact consideration, only one
of them, ‘Principle #4: Designing safer chemicals. Chemi-
cal products should be designed to achieve their desired
function while being as non-toxic as possible,’ (25) is
speciﬁc to human health. While great strides have been
made to design safer chemicals within the chemical
enterprise, there is more work to be done around recog-
nizing the existence within and impact of chemicals on
disadvantaged communities, particularly those of lower
socioeconomic status and communities of color. It is
implicit that green and sustainable chemistry contributes
to social equity and environmental justice because these
innovative technologies have excellent potential to oﬀer
solutions to achieve equity. As well, this fully comp-
lements the dynamic ACS Mission Statement, which is
‘to advance the broader chemistry enterprise and its prac-
titioners for the beneﬁt of Earth and its people’ (1).
Organized conversations around social and environ-
mental justice as a framework to address the why of
green chemistry began at the 20th Green Chemistry
and Engineering Conference in Portland in June 2016
during a symposium on green chemistry and the social
and environmental (in)justice of chemical exposure.
The purpose of this unique symposium was to bring
together, for the ﬁrst time, a multidisciplinary group of
participants to begin exploring the racial and socioeco-
nomic disparities in how hazardous chemicals impact
society. This topic was discussed with over 75 partici-
pants who attended the symposium event.
This justice- and equity-centered symposium has now
been held at the last 3 GC&E conferences (2016, 2017,
2018 and will be again in 2019), each time building on
strong and consistent attendance and sharing knowledge
across disciplines and ﬁelds to better deﬁne, identify, and
determine how to mitigate these issues from a chemistry
perspective. The growth of this symposium is not surpris-
ing. Chemistry professionals connect with green chem-
istry from science, education, and business perspectives.
Others intersect from areas such as public health, toxi-
cology, occupational health, policy, government, engin-
eering, industry, etc. Linking green and sustainable
chemistry to equity and environmental justice inspires
and resonates with a completely new audience (26) and
has expanded the reach of green chemistry’s inﬂuence.
A central theme from these symposia has been how
these topics connect to green and sustainable chemistry.
It is important to note that the narrative of these sym-
posium and subsequent events, workshops, etc, has
never been that ‘chemicals are bad.’ Instead, it has been
an exploration of how diﬀerent sectors of the chemical
enterprise interpret the topics of ‘social equity’ and
‘environmental justice’ and how there is a speciﬁc connec-
tion of justice to green and sustainable chemistry.
Teaching

these
connections
(exposure
impacts on health, disease status, and the environment
as well inequitable access to clean water, air, and food for
communities of color and low socioeconomic status) has
emerged as a signiﬁcant thread in all three symposium
and in the subsequent work that participants have done
within their own institutions to expand their chemistry cur-
riculum to focus more on justice and equity. Another new
and emerging theme is the way in which the ACS and the
chemical enterprise can contribute to equity on a global
scale by contributing to achieving the United Nations Sus-
tainable Development Goals (SDGs) (27). The concept for
using the SDGs to drive forward work that supports

inequitable health and environmental impacts due to
chemical exposure that can be mitigated through
green chemistry principles that inﬂuence the design,
manufacturing, and use of products with an emphasis
in considering human and environmental health (28).
Social justice supports the equality of all in economic,
political, social, and human rights access and environ-
mental justice assumes the same equal access of rights
through regulations and policies of environmental laws
and considerations (28). The community as a whole is
considered as focal as the individual itself and this com-
munity-mindedness advocacy for the health and well-
ness of place and community are an important part of
many student’s values and goals. Research shows that
programs that incorporate aspects of cross-cultural and
social systems are key to student engagement and reten-
tion (29–33) especially for students of color and women
(34, 35). Leadership skills also develop in students
when courses focus on social justice and civic responsi-
bility (36–39), while civic engagement in young adult-
hood has been shown to have a positive impact on
income, education level achieved, and positive mental
health and health behaviors (40). When these concepts
are integrated into major-level courses, students frame
these skills within the context of the subjects studied,
further strengthening their experience in the classroom
(41).
Integrating social and environmental justice frame-
works into chemistry courses and/or programs requires
a multi-faceted approach that involves many pieces of
a complex puzzle. Recently, a two-year endeavor by Kor-
etsky et al. (42) to shift the School of Chemical, Biological,
and Environmental Engineering (CBEE) at Oregon State
University (OSU) toward fostering inclusivity, diversity,
and meaningful experiences for students was under-
taken. Their process included developing and imple-
menting guiding principles that can be used as a
model. These guiding principles exemplify the principles
of green chemistry by including the student experience
as part of the learning process that develops young che-
mists into justice-focused researchers, developers, and
engineers with a systems-level approach to considering
impact. Additionally, by prioritizing pedagogy that sup-
ports successful retention and completion of students
of color and women chemists, (43–45), a more diverse
STEM workforce results as well. The guiding principles
are as follows:
(1) ‘Increasing inclusivity, diversity, and social justice in
engineering
education
requires
active
cultural
changes at organizational/departmental and inter-
personal levels that aﬀect the experiences and per-
ceptions of students and faculty to increase the
degree to which diverse individuals identify as
chemical engineers.
(2) Organized cultural change leads to inclusion when it
reﬂects and aﬃrms the lived experiences of all
members of the community (e.g. students, staﬀ,
faculty, administrators) as people with complex, mul-
tifaceted identities. These changes should align with
our community’s core shared mission of developing
students’ chemical engineering knowledge and
skills.
(3) Explicit pedagogical and social supports for students
and faculty will help to transition their identities,
knowledge and skills from engineering school
world to engineering practice world’ (42).
The following discussion is oﬀered as a toolbox of
foundational language, exploratory research, and idea-
generation that can be used to strengthen the transition
of a traditional chemistry curriculum toward a justice-
centered one.
STEM identity and its impact on student
success
Conﬁdence and science self-eﬃcacy have long been
recognized
as
an
important
indicator
of
student
success and retention in STEM majors, and women his-
torically have less conﬁdence in STEM abilities or per-
ceived success (34, 46–49). In one study researching the
role of identity development and values in STEM reten-
tion, researchers found that conﬁdence in a Chemistry
II class was directly related to course grade and overall
retention in STEM majors. Students who started their
Chemistry II class with more conﬁdence earned a
higher grade than those who did not; students who
earned higher grades in the beginning of the term
gained conﬁdence over the semester and were less
likely to leave their STEM major; and those students
who were conﬁdent in their place within a STEM major
earned higher Chemistry II grades than those who
were not (50). This is good news for those students
who feel like they ‘belong’ in the chemistry major, but
what about those who do not?
Women of color, among other underrepresented
groups, do not persist in STEM at the same rates as
their White male counterparts due to social or interperso-
nal factors, contributing to a lack of a sense of social
belonging in STEM spaces (35, 51, 52). Likewise, women
of color experience microaggressions disproportionality
in STEM spaces, including being questioned about their
‘presence’ in STEM as well as experiencing racial harass-
ment (35, 53, 54). STEM identity is traditionally described
as competitive, individualistic, and solitary (think ‘lone
170

genius’) (34, 55), which disadvantages women and stu-
dents of color who are engaged and retained when
they have access to and belonging within cross-cultural
social systems (29–32). This is of critical importance
when of the 21,821 degrees awarded in chemistry in
2016, only 1,978 were awarded to Hispanic students
and only 1,168 were awarded to African-American stu-
dents (56).
It is important that the space that chemistry exists
within
(be
that
the
classroom,
laboratory,
oﬃce,
program, community, etc.) be inclusive, diverse, and wel-
coming to all students but particularly mindful toward
the additional work required to support underrepre-
sented minority students. One approach is applying criti-
cal race pedagogy in the classroom. Critical race
pedagogy ‘is an instructional approach designed to chal-
lenge and transform the prevailing Eurocentric power
structure that organizes higher education curricula in
order to cultivate spaces that validate the experiences
of Students of Color’ (57). This framework helps minimize
microaggressions in spaces where students are growing
their conﬁdence and self-eﬃcacy around chemistry
success. It also has been shown to empower students
of color when conversations and acknowledgements
are made in regard to system-level biases and discrimi-
nations (57), especially as they exist as barriers for
students.
Acknowledging the role of intersectionality in STEM
identity is also critical. Intersectionality is deﬁned as
‘the social, economic and political ways in which iden-
tity-based systems of oppression and privilege connect,
overlap and inﬂuence one another’ (58). It recognizes
that there are biases occurring at multiple levels when
considering intersectional identity such as gender, ethni-
city, disability, age, veteran status, etc. and prevents indi-
viduals from feeling included. For example, 76.9% of
African-American women in one survey around gender
bias for women of color stated that they were more
likely than other women to have to prove their expertise
and competence (59). Likewise, ‘Latinas who behaved
assertively risked criticism for being angry or ‘too
emotional,’ even when the women themselves reported
that they weren’t angry – they just weren’t deferential.
Nearly 60% of Latinas surveyed noted backlash for
expressing anger, as compared with 54.4% of Asian-
Americans, 49.7% of Whites, and 47.8% of Blacks’ (59).
When learning and research spaces are compromised,
no one beneﬁts.
Social justice education pedagogy
Social justice education as a pedagogy is one that ‘expli-
citly recognizes the disparities in societal opportunities,
resources, and long-term outcomes among marginalized
groups’ (60). A social justice educator is one that models,
aﬃrms, and sustains socially-just learning spaces so that
the student may recognize equitable social relations and
structures in the greater context of work and life. It’s not
just what they are learning but how and why they are
learning it. It explains how a classroom that models
social justice equity inﬂuences the development of
social and equitable decision-making by the student
after the class is over (61, 62), and that ‘using a social
justice lens to actively engage learners in STEM content
provides motivation and engagement not found in
decontextualized academic knowledge.’ It allows stu-
dents to build critical consciousness around the social
function of their chemistry knowledge (63). Since chemi-
cals know no borders, it is important that students recog-
nize the global impact of the work they will be doing and
that they grow a social consciousness that allows for
green chemistry and justice principles to guide pre-pro-
duction design decisions. In the classroom, faculty could
facilitate having weekly discussions around case studies
that highlight regrettable substitutions, environmental,
or human health impacts of chemicals such as DDT,
lead, asbestos, chemicals in cigarettes, eWaste, noeniciti-
noid and chlorinated pesticides, etc. Depending on the
curriculum that week, examples can be brought in that
mirror the content and can complement the required
learning for that unit. Students learn to associate chemi-
cal classes, reactions, and processes with outcomes
beyond the ‘ﬁnal product’ and recognize their role in
supporting outcomes that will not negatively impact
communities and ecosystems.
Hahn Tapper (60) suggests a model of social justice
pedagogy that involves ﬁve pillars: A: Freirean notions
of social justice; B: An examination of individual and
group identities (social identity theory); C: Intersectional-
ity; D: Experiential education (text study, guest speakers,
ﬁeld trips, interactive activities); and E: Responsibility and
empowerment. This model was developed after analysis
of an educational organization founded in 2003 that
oﬀers
intergroup
programs
that
deeply
integrates
social justice (60). This is just one of many models devel-
oped and employed across organizations, agencies, and
educational programs.
It is important to note that while there is no ‘uniﬁed
approach’ to social justice education, there are some
shared principles: ‘[1] There are very real diﬀerentials in
access to social and institutional power between rela-
tionally positioned group members. [2] While all people
have socialized prejudices and can discriminate, only
the dominant group is backed by social and institutional
power, which is multidimensional and constantly operat-
ing, being contested, and renegotiated. [3] Those who
GREEN CHEMISTRY LETTERS AND REVIEWS
171
claim to be for social justice must also be engaged in self-
reﬂection on their own socialization into patterns of
oppression and continually seek to counter those pat-
terns. This is a lifelong project and is not achieved at
the completion of an article or workshop’ (64). Reﬂection
on these shared principles can be a starting point for the
multi-layered work required for integrating social justice
into the chemistry classroom: (1) reﬂecting around your
identity and role in the dynamics of oppression, privilege,
identity, and -isms, (2) understanding that students come
with their own needs to reﬂect and learn more about
these systems and their own place within them, and (3)
and framing curricular learning around justice-related
content.
Some of this work should be done before shifting cur-
riculum toward a justice-centered approach (self-reﬂec-
tion and research and training in cultural-competency,
identity, bias, threats, etc) while other aspects of this
work will happen in the classroom, in real time. Creating
inclusive classroom spaces is also imperative for student
success. Inclusive classrooms require that content be
created that accounts for multiple perspectives and
varied lived experiences from all students. It embraces
how an individual’s values and perspectives are valuable
in how they construct, retain, and apply knowledge (65).
It is also imperative that faculty address their own poten-
tial assumptions around student identity and learning
capabilities. This may be diﬃcult or uncomfortable
passage for faculty who have not yet done this reﬂective
work. One tool to help begin the process of self-reﬂec-
tion is the Implicit Bias test. This test was designed to
help individuals identify internal biases by measuring
‘the strength of associations between concepts (e.g.
black people, gay people) and evaluations (e.g. good,
bad) or stereotypes (e.g. athletic, clumsy)’ (66). It is a fre-
quent starting place for individuals engaging in social
justice pedagogy and advocacy. It is also a great tool
to use with students as their own implicit biases can
shape the classroom community and impact others.
In some instances, inclusivity in the classroom can be
challenged by a very important need to discuss and
investigate the role of racism, bias, etc within lived
experiences of students collectively. Although these con-
versations may result in unintended consequences
(‘altercations between individual students or groups of
students; silence from students who feel intimidated or
fear conﬂict; the assertion and perpetuation of false
stereotypes or problematic assumptions; the expression
of oﬀensive speech’) (65) making sure the conversation
is planned and responses to these issues have been
well-considered will mitigate potential negative out-
comes. A guideline for handling these potentially
diﬃcult moments in the classroom is outlined by
Sensoy and Diangelo (64) as follows: [1] ‘Recognize and
aﬃrm the importance of the conversation, [2] Be
honest about your lack of experience but your willing-
ness to try, [3] Change your pedagogy, e.g. move to
small groups for some discussions, [4] Facilitate by invit-
ing other voices in – e.g. ‘Does anyone have a similar or
diﬀerent perspective?’ ‘Who hasn’t spoken yet?’, [5]
Facilitate dialogue rather than debate, e.g. ‘both/and’
rather than ‘either/or’ frameworks.’ Despite the potential
for diﬃcult dialogue, having the conversations and doing
reﬂective work within self and with students creates an
inclusive and safe learning environment for all students.
Community-engaged participatory research
The history of product development globally has rarely
prioritized consideration for ecological and human
health impacts of the chemicals or products developed.
As a result of this omission, more of these impacts are
being recognized and reported through clinical research
and epidemiological studies, especially within disadvan-
taged communities and populations. Some researchers
are attempting to quantify and qualify those impacts
through work with communities to determine the best
ways to mitigate them. One way in which this occurs is
through
Community-Based
Participatory
Research
(CBPR). CBPR ensures that community members are part-
ners in this research and work, not subjects. It uses
knowledge within the community to design research or
interventions
best-suited
for
the
nuances
of
the
systems within that community and helps connect the
community with the researchers and policy makers to
build relationships. When these parameters are met, it
allows the community to realize the beneﬁts immedi-
ately and directly (67). This model of research diverges
from more traditional research found within STEM pro-
grams,
particularly
in
chemistry
where
the
work
happens in laboratories, not in communities.
Recognizing the role of communities as an integrated
aspect of research requires interpersonal reﬂection on
the equality of communities (especially communities of
color and disadvantaged communities). One must dis-
mantle hierarchies of systems and judgement around
educational, income, class, and race/ethnicity status to
allow community members to be equal partners in
ﬁnding solutions for their issues. Faculty who shift
toward CBPR demonstrate this commitment to diversity
and inclusion by modeling research as a partnership that
beneﬁts all involved, not just the institutions already
advantaged. It is important that there is a direct role
that the community has in the design and conduction
of research and the development of policy around the
issues that directly impact them. This can be diﬃcult
172
G. A. LASKER AND E. J. BRUSH
for a number of reasons, some of which are related to
scientiﬁc and health literacy levels, where 36% of
adults have at or below basic levels in health literacy
skills (68) and the use of complicated language, contra-
dictory health information, and quantity of information
that makes understanding science and health concepts
diﬃcult for individuals, especially those who are of a
low socioeconomic status (69). Likewise, communicating
environmental exposure risks to communities may have
ethical concerns when research hasn’t yet ﬁnalized real
risk outcomes associated with exposures in many
instances (70). Still though. there is still a signiﬁcant
beneﬁt to involving students and communities together
in ﬁnding solutions to issues around chemical exposures
such as helping students develop concepts around cultu-
rally-tailored interventions (71), building leadership skills
(72) and civic responsibility (73), helping to dismantle
hierarchy of academic systems in research (74), increas-
ing critical thinking skills among students (75), and
linking knowledge to action (76). Some barriers for
faculty may include lack of departmental or institutional
support for this type of work, funding issues, and lack of
time to properly build relationships with communities
and to implement CBPR research that meets the criteria
of ethically-responsible engagement.
Systems thinking in chemistry
Systems thinking was conceptualized in 1987 by Barry
Richmond, a pioneer in systems thinking and the
dynamics of systems (77). Later, Arnold and Wade
pointed to a need for a ‘common language and frame-
work’ that allows interdisciplinary teams to share knowl-
edge and solve global issues in part due to the
commonality of this language and framework. The com-
plexity of systems prompted Arnold and Wade (77) to
redeﬁne systems thinking as a ‘system of thinking
about systems,’ and they analyzed eight well-regarded
systems thinking deﬁnitions. They found among them
that ‘common elements tend to include interconnec-
tions, the understanding of dynamic behavior, systems
structure as a cause of that behavior, and the idea of
seeing systems as wholes rather than parts’ (77). Investi-
gating and visualizing this interconnected web of topics,
disciplines, partners, etc., is particularly helpful for chem-
istry students who wish to connect justice to their work
as chemists and designers to directly or indirectly
resolves potential justice-related health and environ-
mental issues. Systems thinking demonstrates chemis-
try’s ‘place’ in the larger context of the world (78) by
challenging student to ‘think about how chemistry may
be used to provide services and functions to other
sciences and end-uses as opposed to being an end all
to itself to advance the science of chemistry’ (79). This
serves justice-oriented outcomes by challenging ideas
of hierarchy and helping students recognize post-pro-
duction impacts in the context of lifecycle inventory
and assessment in product development (79, 80).
Matlin et al. (81) calls for systems thinking in the devel-
opment of a ‘one world chemistry.’ They cite chloroﬂuor-
ocarbons, antibiotics, and plastic waste in the sea as three
examples where the chemical enterprise has applied
principles
of
systems
thinking
toward
recognizing
impacts and devising solutions to concerns. Systems
thinking is inherently interdisciplinary, yet Reeve (82)
suggested that the educational approach may be better
framed as ‘STEM Thinking,’ which is ‘purposely thinking
about how STEM concepts, principles, and practices are
connected to most of the products and systems we use
in our daily lives.’ As students apply what they have
learned within their chemistry courses or programs to
solving problems within the context of systems thinking
assignments or case studies (or on projects across
diﬀerent schools and disciplines of study), they recognize
their impact within these greater systems. Expanding
their question ‘Why am I studying chemistry?’ beyond
STEM-based learning outcomes into social and behav-
ioral, artistic and creative, health and medicine, and
systems of race, culture, and identity, challenges them
to work interdisciplinarily to solve complex issues and
provides relevance to the real-world systems beyond
the classroom and laboratory (28).
Systems thinking analysis is generalized by six steps:
[1] Identify inﬂuences on a desired outcome or process.
[2] Indicate the relative strength of impact of the ident-
iﬁed inﬂuences. [3] Determine how the inﬂuences all
interact. [4] Identify feedback loops that indicate poten-
tial dynamic changes that may occur in a system that
changes. [5] Identify bottlenecks and limitations of the
system. [6] Identify leverage points that can improve
the outcomes or processes identiﬁed (83). Creating class-
room and laboratory exercises that involve systems
thinking analysis as part of the deliverable helps students
identify their role in a bigger system as well as their
opportunity for positive impact as career chemists,
designers, etc. It also increases relevancy for students,
important in particular for students of color and
women (28), and provides context and purpose for
their place in their communities as chemists.
Conclusion
Innovative green and sustainable chemistry technologies
have excellent potential to oﬀer solutions to achieve
equity and environmental justice. However, the STEM
pipeline must be supported by a framework to facilitate
GREEN CHEMISTRY LETTERS AND REVIEWS

the use of social and environmental justice for teaching
and investigating chemistry as solutions to justice
issues. Linking green and sustainable chemistry to
equity and environmental justice has excellent potential
to inspire a new audience of students to pursue STEM
careers and to strengthen the pipeline through the
engagement and retention of students of color and
women. Considering aspects of identity, bias, inclusivity,
community-centered research, guiding principles of
social justice pedagogy, and systems thinking can
guide faculty and staﬀ toward supporting a justice-cen-
tered focus within curriculum that calls for consideration
and protection of human and environmental health. It
provides purpose, relevancy, and vision for chemistry
students and their future careers as change agents.
