“I’m Not Teaching English, I’m Teaching Something
Else!”: How New Teachers Create Curriculum Under
Mandates of Educational Reform
Arthur Costigan
Queens College – City University of New York
This study presents how beginning teachers create and teach an English Language Arts (ELA) cur-
riculum in urban schools in the context of an educational reform movement driven by mandates such
as Common Core State Standards (CCSS), high stakes tests, and prescribed curricula. They serve
in schools with each using unique and individual curricula due to frequent administrative turnover
and reorganization. Through the use of participants’ classroom writings, interviews, and records of
their classroom teaching, this study presents that the participants are neither teaching the content they
wish, nor able to use pedagogies they see as effective. They experience confusion about the nature
of the curricula imposed on them which differs significantly from their understanding of the ELA
curriculum. The curricula they teach has little to do with either personal understandings of ELA, or
how it is presented it in their educational coursework.
I witnessed a lot of fake reading and writing. English wasn’t really taught in the classrooms I’ve
observed, sadly. This led to many bored, disinterested students. All of the reading and writing
that was done had an analytical approach to it … and it certainly wasn’t English. There was
no realness to it, and students weren’t encouraged to feel. Rather, students were encouraged to
pull facts and evidence to support their arguments. To be honest, even without understanding
many teaching theories or practices, it was easy for me to learn that I don’t support that type of
teaching … After observing so many fake English lessons, I became disheartened, that’s not the
type of teacher I want to become. (Kristina’s journal entry for a required preservice classroom
observation).
THE CURRICULUM OF EDUCATIONAL REFORM
Kristina’s words reflect a primary theme that emerges from almost all of the participants in this
study: The English Language Arts (ELA) content they are teaching and the pedagogies they
are using to teach it are not what they view as effective and are not seen as beneficial for their

students. The participants in this study, who are preservice education students engaged in student
teaching, as well as first to third year beginning teachers, present seven successive semesters’
worth of teaching often taking place under high levels of curricular mandates in a city-sized
urban area (Table 1). This study presents the understandings, thoughts, and feelings about the
ELA curriculum through analysis of their reflective writings, through interviews, and through the
records the kept of their teaching (Tables 2–5). These teachers are under considerable pressure
to conform their teaching, both in content and pedagogy, to various types of mandates imposed
because of the educational reform movement. Furthermore, these mandates are imposed in a
range of intensities, from absolute adherence to scripted curricula to relative autonomy. These
mandates most often come from their administrators’ interpretations of various national and state
mandates, such as Common Core State Standards (CCSS) (Common Core State Exam Standards
Initiative, 2014), high stakes tests, and test-based teacher tenure accountability systems.
This article uses the concepts of myth and mythology to understand what is taking place as
they design and implement ELA curriculum in their classrooms in an era of educational reforms
(Berliner & Biddle, 1995; Berliner & Glass, 2014). As defined here, a myth is not simply an erro-
neous, fictitious, or untrue set of beliefs or understandings. Rather, myth is used here as a way of
creating a story or narrative about a number of related beliefs about a complex phenomenon such
as the current educational reform movement (Costigan & Grey, 2014). In this framework, myth
is the story or narrative which elites have created about contemporary educational reform. The
“trueness” or validity of any given myth is not its ultimate purpose; rather, the primary purpose
of a myth is a way of understanding, which is the creation of a “mental construct” or set of re-
lated understandings, beliefs, assumptions, thoughts, and feelings about a complex phenomenon
(Kelly, 1963).
The political and economic elites who advocate, fund, and politically implement educational
reforms have a coherent mythology that bears upon the urban student teachers and beginning
teacher participants in this study. Their mythology maintains: Schools are failing; students are
unchallenged; the curriculum is watered-down; teachers need to be forced into high standards
by authorities; neoliberal ideology including privatization and competition should be applied to
schooling; rigorous testing and strict accountability to authorities raises academic achievement;
social and economic realities such as poverty are irrelevant to student achievement and can be
improved by a curriculum that develops “grit; the purpose of schooling is primarily to enhance
personal economic advancement; and, without schools with rigorous standards our national econ-
omy is in jeopardy (Berliner & Glass, 2014; Costigan & Grey, 2014). Those who are critical of
this mythology have documented that this is a “manufactured crisis” which has changed pub-
lic schooling in harmful ways (Gabbard 2008; Hursh, 2007, 2008a, 2008b, 2014). The study
presented here adds to this critical understanding and shows the impact that the mythology of
educational reform has on the content and pedagogies in urban 7–12 ELA classrooms.
The research presented in this paper asks the following questions of student teachers and first
to third year beginning teachers who are serving populations of urban students who live in com-
munities which are primarily poor or working class, immigrant, non-native English speaking, and
of color and whose classrooms are subject to various educational reforms:
r How do these preservice student teachers and beginning teachers conceptualize, create, and
implement an ELA curriculum for their students?

REFORMS UNDERMINING REFORM
The idea of reform as a social, historical, political, and educational reality has been examined
from a number of academic disciplines including: Political science and cultural studies (Scott,
1998; Jacobs, 1961); social science methodologies in education (McNeil, 1988, 2000; Kennedy,
2005; Costigan, 2013, 2014a; Costigan & Crocco, 2004; Crocco & Costigan, 2006, 2007);
historical studies of schooling in the United State Exams (Katz, 1968; Ravitch, 2000, 2013a;
Ravitch & Maris, 1995); social and philosophical foundations of Education (Berliner & Biddle,
1995; Costigan & Grey, 2014; Gabbard 2008; Hursh, 2008a, 2008b; Hill, Macrine, & Gabbard,
2008); and, in the context of ELA teaching and learning (Costigan, 2008a; Fleischer & Fox,
2004; Kaufman, et al., 2002; Rex & Nelson, 2004; Rigsby & DeMulder, 2003; Smagorinsky,
Lakly, & Johnson, 2002; Smagorinsky, et al., 2004).
Though these studies come from varied academic disciplines and methodologies, several con-
ceptual frameworks inform this study. These conceptual frameworks create a powerful myth,
story, or narrative which is multilayered, and in which various themes overlap to create a powerful
discourse of educational reform. The four that bear on this study are: mythology, authoritarianism,
simplification, and idealism.
Mythology
The prevailing narrative since A Nation at Risk (ANAR; National Commission on Excellence
in Education [NCEE], 1983) tells the story that education is essentially failing. This mythology
EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
209
maintains that school failure is not caused by social and economic inequities, but rather by unchal-
lenged students and deficient teachers (NCEE, 1983). The actual reality, however, is that given
current social and economic inequities, even before our current era of educational reform, student
achievement and school success has been steadily increasing as represented by historically high
graduation rates and other valid assessments of student progress (Ravitch, 2013a). The following
conceptual frameworks of authoritarianism, simplification, and idealism, build on the mytholog-
ical narrative that public schooling is essentially defective and failing, and thus the educational
system cannot be trusted to reform itself (Costigan, 2014a; Gabbard 2008; Hursh, 2008a, 2008b;
Hill, Macrine, & Gabbard, 2008).
Authoritarianism
Reforms to social systems such as schools are almost always imposed by elites rather than through
democratic processes. The local community, as well as the educational research community, are
generally not a part of the discourse of educational reform (Costigan & Grey, 2014; Katz, 1968;
Scott, 1998). The reform agenda has been defined and driven by such elites as Bill Gates and
David Coleman (CCSSI, 2014), Eli Broad, The Walton Foundation, and leaders such as Rahm
Emmanuel (Chicago), Mike Pence (Indiana), Rick Snyder (Michigan), among many others.
Simpliﬁcation
Reforms always impose a unified and simple vision on complex systems as if they were a com-
plicated system (Scott, 1998; Jacobs, 1961). Complicated systems (a watch, an automobile, or a
computer) are comprised of an additive construction of parts that have fairly self-evident func-
tions. These individual parts can be fixed, replicated, and replaced. Complex systems, on the other
hand, are systems in which the parts are interdependent (the brain, a bacterium, a neighborhood,
a school) that cannot be fixed by a simple intervention as in a complicated system (like changing
a carburetor in an automobile or a motherboard in a computer); each part is interdependent, and
interfering in one part of the system affects the whole system (Cochran-Smith et al., 2014). As a
participant in this study explained,
You know of course Bill Gates is doing damage to schools. He’s a computer guy. If a part doesn’t
work, you just fix it. His fix for us is Common Core. But schools don’t work like that. You try to do
one repair and it affects everything else.
Idealism
Idealism is seen by reformers as the imposition of simple, clear, singular and unified remedies, on
the complex, messy, practices of teachers and school traditions. This prescriptive stance discounts
the grounded and practical craft knowledge of teachers as they are engaged in the complex prac-
tical realities of day to day schooling (Densmore, 1987; Scott, 1998). Idealism works in tandem
with the myth of failing schools; for, if schools are failing, then this is a direct result of the de-
fective or deficient practices, and the defective current craft knowledge used by teachers (Hursh,
2007; NCEE, 1983).

COSTIGAN
Since the reauthorization of The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, commonly called
No Child Left Behind (NCLB; US Congress, 2001), and over 5 years under the Race To The
Top (RTTT) initiative (US Department of Education, 2009) and now continuing with the Every
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; US Department of Education, 2015), there have been many voices
critical of educational reforms. The following general criticisms of the educational reform move-
ment bear on this study; namely, ineffectiveness, reductionism, interference, decontextualization,
and unintelligibility:
Ineffectiveness
The lack of evidence of real and beneficial educational improvements stems from nearly 2 decades
of reforms (Gabbard, 2008; Hursh 2007; Ravitch, 2000). This includes the lack of demonstrated
causality that the creation of high standards directly leads to the achievement of high standards
(Ravitch, 2000; Ravitch & Maris, 1995). In particular, standards are especially ineffective in being
met when they are imposed without consultation with teachers (Hursh, 2008a, 2014; Kennedy,
2005).
Reductionism
The reduction in the quality and depth of the curriculum with a test preparation curriculum for
high stakes tests (McNeil, 1988, 2000). The promulgation of large numbers of standards to be met,
but the absence of instruction and assistance in how those standards are to be met and addressed
(Costigan, 2008a, 2008b (Ravitch, 2000; Ravitch & Maris, 1995).
Interference
The reliance on “intentional disruption” as a corporate-style tactic of reform through threat of
punishment and sanctions for non-compliance with imposed reform agendas, including closing
“failing” schools, tying tenure and job security to student test scores, all of that has likely resulted
to a growing teacher shortage (Christensen, Raynor, & Mc Donald, 2015; Ravitch, 2013b).
Decontextualization
The belief that social and economic ills of poverty, racism, and disenfranchisement are irrelevant
and can be ignored or negated by the efforts of dedicated teachers using supererogatory efforts
and curricula provided by the school or for-profit corporations (Brewer, 2014; Costigan, 2008a;
Tell, 2014).
Unintelligibility
In the ELA curriculum in particular, the reality that educational reforms, as imposed con-
structions by non-educators, are often not understood by educators, or are misinterpreted, or
EDUCATIONAL STUDIES

found impossible to implement in actual classrooms. (Fleischer & Fox, 2004; Kaufman, et al.,
2002; Rex & Nelson, 2004; Rigsby & DeMulder, 2003; Smagorinsky, Lakly, & Johnson, 2002;
Smagorinsky, et. al., 2004).
All these critical voices point strongly to the fact that it may be that the reformers themselves
are creating goals and objectives that are simply unobtainable and unrealistic, and that the entire
reform movement is an attempt to eliminate public schooling and to privatize it as a for-profit
enterprise (Costigan & Grey, 2014; Ravitch, 2013).
REFORMS CHANGE “ENGLISH”
For the purposes of this study, content domain of English (a term used in postsecondary studies)
is used interchangeably with ELA (a term used in 7–12 classrooms) because the focus of the
participants’ own education, as well as what they want to teach, is primarily the study of English
Literature (Applebee, 1993). Thus, it is important first to define how educators understand the
study of English to properly examine the ways in which this is revised and integrated by the
participants in light of the curricular demands.
The Modern Language Association (MLA) defines English as follows: (a) To engage with
artistic creation and expression imaginatively; (b) to work both independently and collaboratively;
(c) to develop historical and comparative perspectives by studying the development of societies,
cultures, literatures, and philosophies; (d) to become informed global citizens; (e) to engage with
people across a range of languages, histories, traditions, and ways of seeing; (f) to experience
people and places that are different and distant from those of their families or home communities;
(g) to apply moral reasoning to ethical problems; and, (h) to understand environmental challenges
(MLA, 2008, p. 2).
There is nothing in the MLA that speaks of English as a tool for “college and career readiness”
that are part of the Anchor Standards of CCSS (CCSSI, 2014). In fact, the MLA definition of
English differs from how the CCSS conceives it, in that the reading of literature seems to be of
less value than “reading for information”:
The Common Core asks students to read stories and literature, as well as more complex texts that
provide facts and background knowledge in areas such as science and social studies. This stresses
critical-thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills that are required for success in college, career,
and life. (CCSSI, 2014, emphasis added).
The ELA participants in this study overwhelmingly understand that this and other passages
in CCSS have been interpreted as teaching in writing “the argumentative essay,” and in reading
“informational texts.” These terms cannot be found in any basic text of literary criticism (see
Eagelton, 2008; Guerin, et al., 2005; Scott, 1963).
There is, however, a tradition in the domain of ELA studies where reading is on a continuum
from reading for information, or efferently (Latin, effere, “to take away”) to reading aesthetically,
or reading as a transaction or engagement with a text (Anderson & Rubano, 1991; Rosenblatt,
1978, 1983). The CCSS, like almost all educational reforms, were created without any essential
input from ELA researchers or practitioners, and they advocate that a substantial part of the ELA
curriculum in reading and writing be informational, or fact-based. In the participants’ educational
212
COSTIGAN
coursework, and in the critical texts used in these courses, informational (efferent) reading, that
is reading for information without any aesthetic engagement, is understood to be the simplest,
least engaging, and least rewarding parts of the ELA curriculum (Smith, 1984, 2004; Rosenblatt,
1983, 1978).
METHODOLOGY
The data presented here are based on an ongoing study into how beginning ELA teachers un-
derstand and are influenced by the educational reform movement (Costigan, 2002). The partic-
ipants in the study presented here are enrolled in an undergraduate and graduate English Edu-
cation leading to state certification. There were two types of participants: (a) Those taking one
of two English methods courses for initial or provisional certification who were engaged in a
two-semester program of student teaching with allied ELA methodology course work (Table 1,
Init/Stud T) and (b) those who were taking advanced curriculum courses as beginning teachers
seeking professional or permanent certification (Table 1, Prof/Begin T). Two types of partici-
pants were each 50% (n = 8) of the data sets presented (Table 1). Although the new teachers
have 5 years to complete their professional certification, the overwhelming majority of beginning
teacher participants were in their first to third year of teaching. This study presents no differ-
ences in the data between the undergraduate and graduate participants. Additionally, no differ-
ence was seen in how the preservice student teachers and beginning teachers presented their ELA
curricula content and pedagogies. This may be because the student teachers were teaching with
cooperating teachers, of which 60% had graduated from the same educational program as the
participants.
This study contains two types of data. The first is an analysis of student course writings and
interviews (Table 1, data sets 1–12). The student writings (n = 87) were used by the Principal
Investigator (PI) to understand participants’ understandings of how they conceived, designed, and
implemented their curricula when they were taking classes. These narrative writings provided
interview questions for the interviews and do not appear in the data analysis. The interviews
(n = 20) were conducted roughly half in person and half by phone, lasted from 20 to 40 min, and
are presented in the Data Analysis of this article. The interview questions followed the following
protocol:
1. Tell me about your experiences teaching ELA in your school.
2. How does the way you teach in your school compare with how you want to teach ELA?
3. How are your students affected by the ELA curriculum you teach in your school?
All written data were solicited, all interviews were conducted, and all teaching records were
collected after the end of the class and after the course grades were given. All participants com-
pleted a consent form registered with the college’s IRB. All identifiers were given pseudonyms,
including participants, scripted curricula, and state examinations.
The first set of qualitative data demonstrated that there were almost no coherent patterns
emerging in the curricula content the participant teachers were teaching or in the pedagogies
used to teach it (Table 1, data sets 1–12). In this light, The PI then asked his class members
to record “what you are teaching” to see if there were any themes, trends, or patterns in
EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
213
curricular design or implementation (Table 1, data sets 13–15). In this sense, the records were
not used as quantitative data, but rather as a support of the qualitative data provided by writings
and interviews. Tables 2–4 represent what three data sets of participants reported teaching
during their coursework and these confirm the analysis of the previous data, namely that the
ELA curricula had almost no commonalities. These lists were sorted into three categories of
information provided: (a) pedagogical techniques, (b) ELA content taught other than specific
literary works, and (c) specific literary works taught (Tables 2–4). After this data was collected,
the PI asked his students who were beginning teachers in an advanced curriculum course to
record not only what was taught, but on a Likert-type scale the level of intensity from strongly
mandated (M) to almost completely determined by the teacher, or autonomous (A). Table 5
shows five sample records ranging from heavily mandated curricula to almost completely
autonomous.
It is important to note that the data sought here are not necessarily for comparison with
the theories and pedagogies that can be considered “best practices” by professional standards
provided by National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) (2012) or MLA (2008). What this
study does do, however, is to present the “mental constructs” (Kelly, 1963), or the beliefs, or
the understandings of these beginning teachers. These mental constructs are seen as comprising
the participants’ autobiographical “storied lives” which assist the comprehension of contempo-
rary education issues; that is, the thinking and stories they are presenting about their teaching
(Calderhead & Robson, 1991; Clandinin & Connelly, 2000; Shafer, Downey, & Clandinin,
2014).
Trustworthiness of the data analysis was engendered by a layered research approach involving
informal research during the PI’s classroom teaching in methods and curriculum courses for the
same population as the participants of this study, as well as through participant interviews and
the direct coding of participant-generated documents (Bogdan & Biklen, 1992; Ely, et al., 1991).
Specifically, with three summative interviews, the PI participant checked that the research ade-
quately reconstructed and presented the participants’ understanding (Ely et al., 1991; Lincoln &
Guba, 1985) (Table 1, data set 13, Interview Data Analyzed).
According to the college’s Office of Institutional Research, these participants and educa-
tion students were 60% women and 40% men, and described themselves as living in ur-
ban residential communities. They were 80% white, and considered themselves middle class
or working class. In this they are typical of teachers nationwide in that they are predomi-
nantly white, urban or suburban, female, working class, and they differ from a population of
students who are increasingly self-identified as non-white, poor or working poor, non-native
English speaking, immigrant, or of color (Feistritzer, 2001; Wideen, Mayer-Smith, & Moon,
1998).
The participants all were teaching in a city-sized area that one of the most populous city-
sized area in the United States. This city-sized area is arguably one of the most diverse areas on
in the world (Colangelo, 2009). In this area, there are 2.3 million residents and approximately
48% of them foreign-born (Queens County Borough, 2014). The population consists of 27.6%
non-Hispanic white; 27.5% Hispanic; 22.8% Asian; and, 17.7% African-American. The area
has the locale’s largest share of Colombian, Ecuadorian, Guatemalan, Mexican, Peruvian, In-
dian, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Filipino, Korean and Nepalese populations (Queens Public Library).
The median household income is $53,054 and 15% of the population is below the poverty level
(Queens Public Library, undated).

DATA ANALYSIS
Unsettled Schools—Unsettled Curriculum
The participants in this study taught in urban schools that were in a constant state of adminis-
trative instability. Principals and administrators left or were removed every few years, schools
were closed or reorganized due to low test scores, and each new administration imposed different
curricula and varied curricular mandates virtually every school year. Mary was a particularly ar-
ticulate participant in explaining the relationship between administrative instability and curricular
change as she chose to teach at another school after 2 years in her first teaching position:
My new school is run a little better than what I was used to. It’s an established school that has been
around about sixty or so years, and the principal has been there a while. That is really important to me,
because the principal that I was working under was brand new, and every year it had been completely
changed—the model of teaching … It was too chaotic for anyone to get their bearings, and … it was
getting too ridiculous for me to continue working there.
Mary explains the impact of rapid change had on her school’s curriculum:
In my first year of teaching, we were a project-based school. So, everything that we did was projects.
The class periods were really short, they were only 30 minutes long, and they have in independent
project time for the rest of the day. And that didn’t work out at all. The kids were too young, and
the teachers … didn’t know really how to handle it. So, my principal ended up getting removed
before the end of the first year … And then they hired someone who had something like 15 years’
experience teaching English. So, we were excited. We thought it would be a good thing. But, she had
no experience as a principal. So, I left [for another school].
Over the first 2 years in Mary’s first school, several curricula were implemented, none of
which she found effective. One curriculum was designed by a teacher education institute at a
local university:
We had a lot of coaches because we were partnered with one of these learning institutions and …
they had a lot of specific ideas about how they wanted everything to run, so, you know, every day we
were hearing a lot about how we should be teaching. I was not a big fan of them. And so, the next
year we go to 60-minute class periods and chop out a half hour for everybody’s [individual] lesson.
So, just the constant changes have been a little bit ridiculous—for teachers and students alike.
Mary understands that the imposed curricula had adverse effects on student learning, as well
as their ability to pass the State Exam ELA high school exit examination:
I don’t know how the kids can keep everything straight in their heads. And the kids are not passing
the state exam, because of this inquiry model we were told that we can’t really do exam prep. We
EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
215
have to do state exam prep after school, or during the day at other times, but then none of the kids
would show up after school, so it’s counterintuitive to a certain extent.
Mary also explains a theme that emerges many times in this study; namely, that the directives
of CCSS were misunderstood, and the resulting curricular focus was incorrect (Kennedy, 2005):
And the English Common Core Standards has narrative writing, it has research, it has a lot of different
ways of reaching the students, but the only one that we’re focusing on ever is argumentative writing.
You know, having students choose a side, and then citing relevant textual evidence. And the kids are
reading no more than a paragraph [of informational texts] a day, and by the time they got to me the
kids had no reading stamina. So, when I started teaching literature—I mean 15 pages into the book [Of
Mice and Men], they wanted to be done with it … And luckily one of my colleagues about halfway
through the year said [to the assistant principal], “No, I’m not going to do this. We’re not going to
do this. We’re going back to doing literature.” So, he started teaching literature and the kids started
really responded more to it.
Near the end of her interview, Mary expressed a theme that emerges in this study, namely that
what she is teaching is nothing like the literature curriculum she experienced in secondary and
college-level English courses, nor was her pedagogy that which was advocated in her English ed-
ucational course work: “I’m not teaching English, I’m teaching something else. It’s like teaching
kids like the foundations of reading, or something. It’s not English!”
The Idiosyncratic Curriculum
In the first part of this study, during the first 5 years of analysis of the participants’ narrative writ-
ings and interviews (Table 1, data sets 1–12), it became clear that each participant was teaching
under many differing types of, and intensities of, curricular mandates. They responded to these
different mandates in individual ways, and the result was that each was teaching almost com-
pletely different curricula. This was true even though they were teaching in the same city-sized
area with similar social and economic demographics, as well as the fact that almost all of the
participants’ schools could be considered at risk for closure or reorganization because of low
test scores on mandated high stakes tests. Nevertheless, despite these similarities, the participants
revealed that each school, each English department, and each teacher, responded in very differ-
ent ways. The term idiosyncratic curriculum is used in this study in the sense of its commonly
accepted definition of peculiar to the individual teacher-participant.
Because of the absence of commonalities in the participants’ curricula over the first five
semesters of this study, in Spring 2015 the PI asked his pedagogy and curriculum classes to record
on data sheets “what they taught” during his ELA pedagogy and curriculum courses (Table 1, data
sets 13–15). These records reflect the participant’s creation of idiosyncratic curricula found in the
more extensive and intensive data in the previous analysis of student class narrative writing and
participant interviews (Tables 2–4).
In Fall 2015, the PI asked one class of beginning teacher participants to record in greater
detail not only what was taught, but to indicate on a Likert-type scale what levels of mandates or
autonomy influenced their teaching of that particular curriculum (Table 1, data set 16). Table 5
216
COSTIGAN
presents five representative samples of these records ranged from the most mandated (M) to the
most autonomous (A). These again demonstrate (a) the great variability of what was taught, but
also (b) the different levels of pressure the participants were under.
For instance, one participant was required to teach a semester’s worth of Greek Myths. An-
other participant’s English department committee had decided to teach Bram Stoker’s Dracula,
and another Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein. In the case of the two novels mentioned, the two partic-
ipants received no rationale for these choices, and they struggled with the difficulty of teaching
novels that their urban students found difficult. Many classrooms were mandated to spend signif-
icant time on test preparation. Many were required to be aligned with CCSS, and many required
teachers to write standards on the board, and several administrators mandated students to copy
the standards into their notebooks. Other schools required that a certain lesson plan format be
used, or that pedagogical techniques such as “mini-lessons” or “think-pair-share” be included in
lessons. Several participants reported a lock step curriculum in content and pedagogy, often in the
first month of the semester as class sizes were adjusted, where all teachers per grade level were
teaching the same content on the same day. Roughly 20% of the participants, such as Mary (pre-
viously mentioned), responded to presumed CCSS mandates to teach “the argumentative essay,”
and “informational texts” (see Table 5.1). Paradoxically, about 10% of the participants reported
almost complete autonomy to teach whatever they wanted (see Table 5.5). Supervision systems
ranged from almost daily roughly 3 min walk throughs, to full period observations ranging from
one to six times a semester, to mandated bulletin board formats in middle schools, and regu-
larly submitted samples of student work to be reviewed by administrators. In short, among all
the participants there was no commonalty of the content that was mandated to be taught, nor the
pedagogies used to teach it.
Educational researchers have long concluded that most ELA classrooms across the United
States are relatively similar in content and pedagogy (Kennedy, 2005; Cuban, 1984). However,
this was not the case with this study’s participants. For instance, it is unlikely that Dracula is taught
in many, ELA classrooms; yet, even if it were an occasional part of the ELA curriculum—and it
is not—it is not clear at all to this particular participant why it was chosen and mandated, or what
are the benefits to students. Furthermore, it is not clear to the PI, who has observed classrooms as
a teacher educator for 17 years, and is a former urban high school teacher of almost 14 years, what
are the following pedagogies presented in curriculum records: “attach the prompt,” “cold call,”
“Do Now inquiry starter,” “show-call,” “batch feedback,” “stretch the question,” and “teaching
point,” among many others (Tables 2–3; Table 1, data sets 13 and 14). What was clear is that the
participants were not conceiving of the curriculum in any way they had experienced it as students,
nor in any essential way as advocated in their educational coursework, nor as comparable to NCTE
or MLA standards.
The Wash-Out of Educational Coursework
In their educational coursework the conceptual framework of curricular design was presented
as centered on conceptual units that are cohesive, extensive, and able to be clearly assessed
(Smagorinsky, 2007). These units should possess a thematic focus on an important concept
in ELA studies, should contain integral works of literature and writing related to that theme,
should use appropriate pedagogies to engage students with concepts and literature, and should be
EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
217
appropriate to the students and meaningful for them. The units should be extensive, intercon-
nected, and integrated with each other (Applebee, 1993; Costigan, 2008a; Gaughan, 2001; Pirie,
1997). This is the conception of curriculum design in the text used in both methodology courses
the participants were taking or had taken (Smagorinsky, 2007).
Such a conception of the curriculum typically requires an intensive and extensive one to three-
week units with specific pedagogies to support that unit that include reading strategies and writing
processes, including time for editing and revision (Costigan, 2008a; Smagorinsky, 2007). How-
ever, the average curricular units presented in this research are short units of only a few days that
were not thematically interconnected with each other, and that varied greatly in objectives, con-
tent, and pedagogy. This is clearly represented in Table 5 where the average unit is 3.3 days, and
where there are only four curricular units out of 51 units presented that are longer than one week.
The units do not seem to progress in any logical fashion, they do not seem related to each other,
and there does not appear to be any cohesion of focus in the units presented (Table 5). Marissa
explains why this may be so:
They come at me from all angles, each and every day. Common Core, lesson plan formats, getting
them ready for the state exams, submitting my lesson plans to the AP for review, getting my
bulletin boards in order with exemplar student works, being observed by the principal on his walk
throughs … It’s too much.
In educational research, to oversimplify somewhat, wash out theory applies to beginning
teachers and explains the ways in that their educational coursework that is usually progressive,
constructivist, inquiry-based, or student-centered is washed out by the everyday realities of the
classroom and the rituals, traditions, and requirements of daily schooling (Calderhead & Robson,
1991; Zeichner & Tabachnik, 1981). In other words, this theory holds that within the context of
the quotidian realities of schooling, new teachers typically revert to their “implicit institutional
biographies,” (Britzman, 1986) and replicate the traditional schooling they experienced when
they were students, effectively washing out what is learned in educational coursework (Lortie,
1975). After a few years, however, once they become more comfortable teaching, new teachers
may then apply some of the more constructivist, student-centered practices recommended in
their educational coursework (Rust & Orland, 2001).
Wash out theory was a research conversation that emerged before the current educational re-
form movement was formally implemented with NCLB in 2001. However, the participants in this
study support this theory in that the conflicting demands placed upon them wash out possibili-
ties for curricula which they see as personally and professionally rewarding, and beneficial for
their students. The result is a praxis shock when new teachers are stymied in making the transi-
tion between their university coursework and the test- and accountability-driven realities of urban
schools (Smagorinsky et al., 2004). Note that Nadine in Table 5.5 reports that her curriculum was
highly autonomous, yet she is responding to what she perceives as the demands of CCSS by teach-
ing informational texts. In Table 5.5, curricula G and H are clearly guided by perceived CCSS
demands, but many other curricula may also be her interpretation of what needs to be taught for
the perceived demand for students to process informational texts.
The participants indicated that what was primary in creating their own curricula was the type of,
and intensities of, mandates they were given in designing and implementing their own conceptions
218
COSTIGAN
of the ELA curriculum. They identified the following issues as primary. They are ranked from the
most restrictive to the least restrictive:
(M) Curricular Mandates
r Scripted lessons and curricula purchased from educational publishers, corporations, or univer-
sity think tanks
r Curricular demands due to perceptions of CCSS demands (reading informational texts, writing
argumentative essays)
r Student assessment systems by for-profit organizations
r Authorized and unauthorized use of elements of scripted lessons and curricula promulgated by
school supervisors
r Mandated lesson plan formats, designed by school or adapted from scripted programs
r Mandated formal lesson plan elements (e.g. mini-lessons, the workshop model, copying the
Aim or CCSS standards)
r Lock step curriculum per grade level (for at least one month per semester)
r Administrative mandates for specific ELA content (literature, informational tests), or pedago-
gies (inquiry-based learning, tiered instruction)
r Texts assigned per level or grade for thematic unity
r Texts assigned per level or grade for equal distribution and availability
r Bookroom text availability
r Teacher choice
(A) Curricular Autonomy
The aforementioned issues superseded the participants considering: (a) the assessed academic
needs of each class of students, (b) the personal curricular interests of the teacher in teaching
certain texts, (c) using preferred pedagogies to teach, and (d) applying methodologies advocated
in educational coursework.
Individuality
Each of the participants were each telling their own stories, and these stories seldom overlapped
with the stories of other participants (Clandinin & Connelly, 1996; Shafer, Downey, & Clandinin,
2014). The stories were unique or because the schools, and the teachers in them, were all
responding to various curricular mandates in various individual ways without consultation with
each other. As Patrick summarized in an interview:
They tell me what to do, they tell me what books are available to teach. They tell me how I have to
teach it based on the state exam and the critical lens essay. They tell me what texts I have to use and
how long I have to teach it. The rest is up to me to try to keep the kids’ interest enough to get all this
through [to them].
Furthermore, each participant had individual and idiosyncratic curricula within the context of
her own workload, and different curricula and pedagogies were often applied to the same grade
level in different class sections. As Diana explains:
EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
219
Well, yes, I have two English 10 classes [freshman second semester], but one is on level, and the other
is not on track. So I have to teach them differently. With the on level I’m teaching Lyddie, which is what
the [English] Department wants, but with the other I’m allowed to use a mix of “All Can Succeed!”
[a scripted curriculum] that is short informational texts supplanted by readings [literature] from the
class library I’ve developed.
It is important to add that almost all the participants had classes arranged by academic ability,
but in no case was the classification based on exactly the same criteria. Sometimes it was a grade-
level reading score based on various assessment systems, sometimes overall GPA, and most often
a test score on various mandated tests. One participant had “low functioning” students in her ninth-
grade “remedial English” class based on failing scores on a standardized state math examination.
When Diana was asked why the curriculum committee of her school had chosen a particular
semester long curriculum for all students, she responded:
I never thought to ask why …. You know, I’m new at the school, so I’m just trying to juggle so many
things that I was glad in a way that I was given the [scripted] curriculum … but, no, I don’t know
why they chose Lyddie for the sophomores.
One participant, Steve, explained that he based his curriculum on teaching for the state
exam because he had to attain tenure within three years based on the Department of Educa-
tion’s Measures of Student Learning Basics (MOSL) scores. In MOSL, Steve’s teaching ef-
fectiveness is rated based 40% on “student learning” (as represented on state exams), and
60% on “measures of teacher practice” (through school authorities’ classroom observations; see
http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/advance/). He summed up the situation succinctly and directly:
You know raising the MOSL scores so I can keep my job is like a blind [person] searching for a black
cat in a dark room. I just do whatever the fuck I have to—to get these kids to do well on the tests.
Every class is a prep for the state exam. That’s not [me] being totally selfish, because if I’m out, then
who will they get next year to teach them?
It is important to note that Steve was only one of a handful of participants throughout the study
who even mentioned MOSL, and those few who mentioned it were not as concerned as they felt
sure that the 60% measure of teaching practice would be based on a history of positive supervisor
evaluations which would grant them tenure. With MOSL as with various curricular mandates,
each participant was teaching under radically different interpretations of standards, with different
demands and accountabilities placed upon them, and with varying levels of accountability.
Creativity
As the data was coded, it became clear to the PI that there were three categories or “mental
constructs” (Kelly, 1963) by which the participants understood the ELA curriculum.
1. Pedagogies. The techniques of teaching and learning that were used to present ELA
content to their students (graphic organizers, peer editing, popcorn reading, think-pair-
share) (Table 2).
220
COSTIGAN
2. Concepts. The overarching ideas, themes, or mental constructs by that ELA is organized,
differentiated, and understood (Kelly, 1963). These could be (a) thematic (The American
Dream, Explorer Unit, Patriarchal Society), (b) genres (short story, drama, poetry); (c)
elements of reading (finding theme, point of view, independent reading); or, (d) elements
of writing (argumentation, citing evidence, literary essay). (Table 3)
3. Literature. The texts that were thought worthy of presenting to their class (A Street Car
Named Desire, The Naked Truth, “The Nymph’s Reply to the Shepherd”) (Table 4)
Although some categories overlapped—for instance Raleigh’s “The Nymph’s Reply to
the Shepherd occurred in a poetry unit—this is not how the participants listed their curricula
(Table 5). They chose to focus their units and their teaching on one of the above categories on
only infrequently combined categories. That is, Noor, the teacher of “Shepherd” poem could
conceive of teaching this poem in several possible ways:
1. A short 1 or 2 day unit of teaching this particular poem (this is what she did);
2. As teaching a 3 day unit on the three “Shepherd” poems, Marlowe’s original poem and
Donne and Raleigh’s variations on Marlowe’s poem (or several other variations on the
poem by modern poets);
3. As a thematic unit on the pastoral poetic tradition, whether as literature in translation or
not;
4. As a thematic unit on love, or as a gender based expression of love (some critics think
that the male speaker/suitor in Marlow’s poem is addressing another male); or,
5. As an example of a poem of persuasion (Koch, 1990, pp. 224–225)
However, this is not how this participant, or any participant, conceived of their curricula. With
few exceptions, they taught either based on (a) pedagogies, or (b) ELA content and themes, or (c)
individual works of literature. The participants did not present curricular units as organized by
a theme, overarching concept, or theoretical framework (Smagorinsky, 2007; Costigan, 2008a).
They created curricula that addressed one pedagogy or way of knowing, one ELA concept, or one
work of literature (Table 5). These were not presented as conceptual units (Smagorinsky, 2007).
It is worth noting, that from the perspective of the critical traditions in the study of English as
found in college bulletins, there are several categories that are not present in these participants’
responses: (a) Literary periods (Romantic Poetry, The Modern Novel, Contemporary Drama),
(b) cultural themes (Women’s Literature, Queer Studies, Post-Colonial Literature), or (c) literary
theory (New Critical Approaches, Reader-Response Criticism) (Eagelton, 2008).
The participants’ creation of a singular focused curriculum, however, is not through inspiration,
nor is it casual, nor is it automatic; rather, it is a careful and complex process. It is fair to say,
paradoxically, that the higher level of curricular mandates the more creativity and construction of
the curriculum was required. Thus, mandates that are designed for high conformity result in the
very opposite of standardization and conformity as they require a creative, individualistic, and
even idiosyncratic response.
Manny, in Table 5.1 is one of the few participant teachers to combine a pedagogically-based
unit with a literature based unit (A Long Walk to Water and notice and note). Notice and note
is a term for close reading, a technique that is perceived to be demanded by CCSS in reading
informational texts (Beers & Probst, 2012). As this Table 5.1 indicates, he chose to base almost

defined literary elements (notice and note, character traits, inferences). Such combining of ele-
ments, again, was rare. This table indicates that Manny is trying to integrate what he or school
authorities interpret as effective for the CCSS’s apparent demand for developing skills in reading
informational texts. This is coupled with his personal and professional interest in two particular
short stories.
The curricula that teachers created was creative, individual, and idiosyncratic because even
when participants were teaching under high levels of supervision and accountability, they still
had individually interpret the curricular mandates. They still had to create a curriculum. Even
scripted lessons did not just get taught. Stephanie was mandated to teach Walter Dean Meyer’s
Monster, a young adult novel she considers “a great book.” However, Stephanie explains her
difficulties with a scripted program she is mandated to use:
Stephanie: I can’t just teach what I want. I have to tweak it all the time. Like teaching Monster
according to [a scripted program], that is really difficult because [in the novel] some is written like a
movie script and some like a narrative and this is way too difficult for my low level ninth graders to
keep shifting the point of view.
PI: So, how do you do it?
Stephanie: Well, ah, first I have to figure out what they want me to do, then I have to interpret how I
can do this with my kids, and you know, it’s difficult to do.
PI: How so?
Stephanie: If I only had to face Monster with my low level kids, bad enough, I’d figure out how to do
it, but it’s like there’s an extra mountain there and I have to link it all up with the [Advance!] program,
how they want me to do it step by step.
Further discussion with Stephanie revealed that the Advance! program was not designed for
a classroom that included students with learning disabilities, many with IEPs who required the
presence of a paraprofessional in the class for academic support. Thus, the participants under
the highest levels of accountability had to do more creative thinking to figure out how to teach
content not of their own choosing, and to teaching it in ways they would not do so if given
autonomy.
The Internal and the External Curriculum
All the participants came to their teaching with a deep and complex understanding of what is
ELA or English, and that is that this is the teaching of literature. This is not, however, what they
are asked to teach. A comparison of Tables 3 and 4 indicate that teaching the concepts of ELA is
a much more significant part of their curricular thinking than teaching literature. Maria spoke of
this conundrum in an early interview:
All I have spent my time doing in college was reading literature. You know Virginia Wolf, multicul-
tural literature, Shakespeare, and that’s what I thought I would be teaching. But now all this crazy
stuff is coming at me. I have to constantly teach the argumentative essay, which I suppose is alright.
But when I started teaching it, I used a five paragraph theme [as in college]. So I was blissfully figur-
ing out to do this when my buddy teacher came in and said to me after he observed me, “You know,
222
COSTIGAN
that makes sense from what you know, but here we have to do it in four paragraphs, so you’d better
do it the way the AP wants and the way it’s found on the state exam.”
Apparently the “internal” understanding of what comprises ELA, and the university-based
understanding of what comprises ELA is not what these teacher participants are explicitly asked
to teach. The participants’ internal curriculum does not match the external curriculum demanded
of them.
Students
Although students were not a direct focus of this article, a theme that emerges is that the over-
whelmingly white, working class and female participants understand that their urban students
have different academic perceptions and expectations than they do (Feistritzer, 2001). They con-
sistently report that they are trying to bridge the gap to understand and “reach” their students.
The mandates they are under are generally seen as a factor that interferes with the difficult task
of bridging the gap between the teachers’ ideas about the ELA curriculum and their students’
willingness to accept it. Chandra explains this interference:
It’s hard enough to try to reach the kids, to get them interested in it, to get them to like reading and
writing—like I do. Now I have the assistant principal coming down on me about having target samples
of student work in their portfolios for when the district [supervisors] come in. And that’s all they care
about.
Ivana also explains this phenomenon:
Missing is if the kids like reading, if I can get them to read. They hate reading, and I think it’s the way
they’ve been taught it in school that makes them hate it. They hate the literature journals I have to
make them do according to the [school’s mandated] format. They hate reading 10 books a semester.
But that’s what I have to do. I’m asked to teach in a way that makes them hate reading.
Nevertheless, it seems clear that both teachers and school authorities are confused about what
CCSS and other mandates ask them to do, and that in response both authorities and teachers
create individualistic and idiosyncratic curricular responses to those actual or perceived demands.
Ultimately this process of addressing mandates hinders an already difficult process of reaching
their students.
DISCUSSION
The experience of these participants is similar to the explanation that Ravitch (2000, 2013b),
among others, gives explaining why attempts at educational reform fail, despite the popular
and political power of the mythology of educational reform: (a) Mandates are imposed by
non-teaching authorities without consideration of the actual situations of teachers; (b) the
EDUCATIONAL STUDIES

mandates are hard to understand, hard to interpret, and are easily misunderstood because they are
counter-intuitive and disruptive of teachers’ craft knowledge; and (c) the mandates themselves
may be impossible to implement as given the actual ecology of the ELA classroom (Fleischer &
Fox, 2004; Kaufman, et al., 2002; Smagorinsky, Lakly, & Johnson, 2002).
This study, however, finds that something more radical is happening. The very substance and
nature of the ELA curriculum has been altered to something that is not recognized by the partici-
pants essentially as English. The only way the participants can implement the literature curricula
they know is to find small pockets of time in their mandated schedule to teach it. The rest of the
time is teaching a curriculum that is strange, counterintuitive, confusing, disheartening, and inef-
fective. Close reading is not used in any way which is advocated in New Criticism texts (Eagelton,
2008); aesthetic transactions with literature are seen as prohibited; the so-called argumentative
writing that students produce is of a style not found in a newspaper, magazine, or blog post; and,
writing is done in in forms and by processes which authors do not use in the real world (Costigan,
2008a).
The reason for such an unusual curriculum need not be mysterious at all. The mandates the
participants experience come from educational reforms which are focused not on the teaching of
English as English, but the teaching of English as a means for so-called college and workplace
readiness (CCSSI, 2014). The development of ELA reading and writing competencies, as defined
by MLA or NCTE, is of no concern to educational reformers who come from the corporate world
(Costigan, 2014a). The notion of English as the aesthetic appreciation of works of literature,
or as engagement with authentic writing processes to create genuine writing artifacts, is of no
concern of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and David Coleman who have created, sponsor,
and promulgate CCSS, nor has it been on the agenda of the recent United State secretaries of
education, nor is it a concern of the new ESSA, nor of state governors and mayors who currently
privatizing public education in through advancing charter schools (Network for Public Education,
2016).
This study has, of necessity, limited its focus to teachers, not students. Nevertheless, the ef-
fects of educational reform mandates on students is a primary concern of the participants. The
participants are concerned that the curricular mandates are detrimental to their students in several
ways, as is shown in particular in Mary’s narratives at the beginning of the Data Analysis section:
First, curricular mandates prohibit the participants from creating a personalized and meaningful
curriculum for their students; second, the curriculum bores the students and creates resistances to
English; and third, students unfairly do not experience the true literature curriculum (see MLA,
2008). Students only read for “textual evidence” in short samples of text which is, as Mary states,
“like teaching kids like the foundations of reading, or something. It’s not English!”
Considering that these students are from communities which are urban, poor or working poor,
non-native English speaking, immigrant, or of color, an issue arises which was not originally a
direct part of this research; namely, that as is typical across the United States, these participants
come from very different residential neighborhoods than their students. Unlike their students, the
participants typically live in more residential or suburban neighborhoods, consider themselves
working or middle class, are native-born, and are native English speakers (Colangelo, 2009;
Queens County Borough, 2016; Queens Public Library, undated). This cultural and economic
discontinuity, and the issues that arise from it, are an important strand of educational research
because many studies show that teachers want to teach, and are only comfortable teaching,
students similar to themselves (Wideen, Mayer-Smith, & Moon, 1998; Feistritzer, 2001).

COSTIGAN
The participants in this study are obviously concerned with the ELA curriculum as an objec-
tive curriculum; that is, teaching literature as a presentation of human issues and human values.
However, previous studies with this specific population of participants have documented the dis-
connect between these participant-teachers who value school as a means for social advancement,
and their students who often are disengaged form the formal schooling they experience. In other
words, research shows that this population of participants struggles to reach students who are
different than they are (Costigan, 2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2008b). Given the disconnect between the
home communities of the participants and the home communities of their students, how to bridge
such gaps is an important consideration for further investigation.
Teaching for equity is one of the key components in the mission statement of the school of
education in which the participants are enrolled, but this is not expressed in any of the data other
than their attempt to engage students academically in the best and most effective ways possible.
If the participants could develop a curriculum that they thought was meaningful, beneficial, and
effective for their students, there could be hope that they could begin building bridges between
their home cultures and their students’ home cultures to address the manifest social and economic
disadvantages presented in local schools. What the myriad and ever changing mandated curricula
do is to prohibit the time and energy which can be applied to building these bridges. It is an integral
conceptual framework of all educational reforms that they are designed to be valueless. This
assumes that, through the imposition of mandates, standards, and rigorous tests, issues of class,
economic background, cultural capital, gender, sexuality, access to resources, and the discourse of
the home communities, simply do not matter (Costigan, 2014a). The educational reform culture
not only prohibits the teaching of the content and pedagogy of English, it also prohibits teachers
exploring it as an agency of equity and social justice.
This disconnect between the goals of reformers and their reforms and the craft knowledge
of the communities on whom they are imposed is a longstanding phenomenon in all reform
movements, whether the reforms are social, economic, geographical, agricultural, or educational
(Jacobs, 1961; Scott, 1998). In a study of local educational reforms in nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, Katz explains:
We still have to see a movement driven by a desire to bring a joy to the life of the individual, to
enrich experience solely for the purpose of making life more full and lovely. The goals of [reform]
movements, quite to the contrary has been extrinsic; they have stressed the needs of society and
the economy. They have also been utilitarian, stressing the concrete value of schooling to the
individual … Goals have been formulated with scant regard to the indigenous culture, even the
aspirations, of the working-class groups to be reformed … The reformers have determined to foist
their innovations on the community, if necessary by force. (Katz, 1968, p. 214).
When teachers have to address curricular demands designed for the utilitarian needs of so-
called college and career readiness, the reforms ignore the professional understandings of the
people on whom reforms are imposed. In turn, the reforms themselves violate the very purposes of
ELA studies as defined by the ELA profession, particularly in the objectives of enhancing student
engagement with the artistic creations of literature, with enhancing the imaginative expressions
of writing, and with the development of critical perspectives about the ethical issues of our time
(MLA, 2008, p. 2).
EDUCATIONAL STUDIES

As for the content domain of ELA, to their regret, what they are now teaching in their class-
rooms has become a violation of English. This occurs through the seemingly deliberate process
of removing all critical thinking, personal engagement, and adherence to the traditions of ELA
content and pedagogy, and replacing these values and objectives with an emphasis on a deval-
ued, decontextualized, and uncritical reiteration of prepackaged information and facts, without
any meaningful engagement with the important issues they represent. This is precisely the cur-
riculum that the political and corporate elite have created through their powerful mythology of
educational reform. It is an English curriculum devoid of all substance and meaning. For the
preservice and beginning teachers in this study, this is a curriculum which is not English.
