1. Different Abilities
Lead students in a discussion about people with disabilities:
Many people have a wide range of abilities and disabilities. Some people have disabilities that
you can see right away. For example, some people use a wheelchair to help them get around.
Can you think of other disabilities people have?
●
People with hearing problems might need to use a hearing aid.
●
People who have trouble seeing might need to use a cane or a guide dog.
But some people have disabilities that you can’t see right away. Some kids have learning
disabilities like dyslexia. People with dyslexia often have a hard time with words and reading.
2. Assistive Technology
Because many people have different abilities, not everyone can use the standard
computer. However, with a little extra hardware or software, computers and the
Internet can be accessible to people with a wide range of abilities.
Assistive Technology is any device or software that is customized to make life easier for a
person who has a disability or special needs. Examples of assistive technology:
❏ A keyboard with large keys for people with low vision
❏ Software that converts speech to text
❏ A printer that converts a website content, for example,
into a braille print out so a blind person can read it on
their own (explain what braille is ).

❏ Software that reverses the screen to light text on to a dark background for people that
are very sensitive to light.

Let’s take a look at an example of a simple assistive computing technology for people with
hearing impairment:
Play a few seconds of the following video:
https://tinyurl.com/ycgaoq2t
Prompt students to name some people who might not be able to know what the video is saying.
Possible answers could be people that don’t understand English, people that are too young to
understand and of course people who cannot hear.
Then prompt students to suggest changes to the video that would help people with hearing
impairments.
Replay the video, but this time turn on closed caption (CC) by clicking on the CC icon at the
bottom of the screen. Point out and explain this feature to students.
Closed captioning (CC) refers to the text version of the spoken words that accompany videos or
movies so that deaf and hard of hearing people can also enjoy watching movies.
3. Student Activity: Who Uses Which Assistive Technology
Explain the activity and distribute the activity worksheet to students. Allow time to go
over the answers.
4. Class Discussion and Wrap Up
Discussion Points
●
What are some examples of how software and hardware can help people with certain
disabilities?
●
Why is it important to have assistive technology?
●
In which ways do you think technology will continue to improve to help more people
with disabilities?
