Abstract

INTEGRATING ETHICS INTO A COMPUTER SCIENCE CURRICULUM 
FOCUSING ON DATA SCIENCE ISSUES 
 
by 
 
Sai Sri Meghana Dharmapuri 
 
 
 
 
  
Computer science has rapidly evolved over the years particularly in the field of 
machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Yet, there seems to be noticeable 
gap in the field of ethics related to data science for K-12 students. This project aims to 
introduce K-12 students to the concepts of data science ethics and educate them at an early 
stage to ensure a path towards ethical data science practices. With this goal to educate K-
12 students on data science ethics, a tailored instructional plan to support K-12 students 
and academic advisors was identified.  
Like every field, computer science has a set of morals to be followed. It is essential 
for students to understand the basic social, ethical and legal issues that can arise when 
solving real world data problems. Without proper ethical paradigms, technology can have 
serious negative impacts on the society and efforts should be made to educate students on 
ethics to ensure a future with reliable technology. While the internet has a plethora of 
information related to data science ethics, there is a need for platforms that are tailored 
 
 
vi 
 
 
towards educating K-12 students and create awareness, interest and a sense of motivation 
among them. 
To solve this problem, I designed a visually interactive instruction tool, using a 
story telling chat box, quizzes and a case study, intended to introduce data science ethics 
focused on the areas of explainable AI, privacy, informed consent and ownership of data. 
The aim of this project is to motivate students to pursue a path towards practicing ethical 
data science. The tool intends to reduce the risk of biased and unethical problem solving to 
protect human morals when technology is involved.
