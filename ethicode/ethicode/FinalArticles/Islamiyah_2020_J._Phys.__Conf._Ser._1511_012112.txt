Abstract. The purpose of this study was to determine the differences in the effectiveness of the 
computer-based “color mixing maze games” to stimulate symbolic thinking for the 
development of learning science in early childhood in the new era of industry 4.0. 23 samples 
in one kindergarten in Surabaya were used for this study consisted of 13 children (TK A1) for 
the experimental group and 10 children (TK A2) for the control group. This research was a 
type of quantitative experimental research using the Quasi-experiment method and the Non-
equivalent Control Group Design. The Independent Sample T-Test was used for the data 
analysis technique and N-Gain with SPSS 21 was used for the effectiveness test. The results of 
the effectiveness test depicted a result of the Sig≤0.05 value and thus Ho was rejected and Ha 
was accepted, which means that there were significant differences in effectiveness computer-
based “color mixing maze games” compared with paper-based games to stimulate symbolic 
thinking in the development of learning science in early childhood. Computer-based games are 
stated to be able to provide the right understanding in the learning process including science 
learning in recognizing mixing colors. 
1.  Introduction 
In the new era of industry 4.0, all matters will be related to technology that continues to develop and 
become part of the harmony between human life and technology or machinery. Klaus stated that 
industrial revolution 4.0, emerged around 2010, developed through the internet which was the center 
of all things becoming a link between technology or machines and humans [1]. The fourth industrial 
revolution is not only a trigger for developing technology but also for human resources. Humans must 
continue to adapt and innovate in living systems so that they can be in harmony with existing 
technological developments, including in the process of education or learning. The existence of the 
fourth industrial revolution gives rise to the term of education 4.0 which is a way of integrating 
learning and technology [2]. Interesting learning content is one of the developments in digital games 
which is one of the uses of technology [3]. As an initial education, PAUD (Early Childhood 
Education, which is roughly equivalent to "pre-school or ECE" in English) becomes the most 
important period in a child's development. Learning that does not utilize technology in the process at 
school makes PAUD's goal to prepare children for further education is not maximally carried out yet. 
The success of humans in adapting to the development of the era is very dependent on the 
childhood which is the root in human life. Children are very easy to be given stimulation to practice 
their abilities, including cognitive abilities to develop children's scientific capabilities in symbolic

thinking about color. The ability to think symbolically in children is the recognition and the use of the 
symbols on an object [4]. Color is one of the symbols that is very pivotal for children because 
knowing color can be a benchmark or early detection effort for color blindness. Recognizing colors 
and mixing colors are one of the science learning needed for early childhood but there are still many 
children who have not been able to distinguish colors and understand their mixing.  
The process of arranging children's sense of sight in recognizing color symbols is part of science 
learning for early childhood. Early childhood science learning aims to train children to be able to use 
all five senses as a tool in recognizing various events and objects both living and dead objects [5]. 
Learning science is very important to be introduced early on to children because of the development of 
the era so it demands humans to improve their ability to master technology and science [6]. Science 
learning about mixing colors will be easier to understand if we can take advantage of the game as an 
effective media. Games are very attached to the world of children which is one factor in knowing the 
world [7]. The game aims as a communicative, fun, and educative media [8]. Game is one of the 
important tools for children in developing their cognitive aspects so that children can improve their 
knowledge skills by playing the game [9]. Games will be very interesting if it can be maximized by 
using computer technology or other electronic media. The way of providing learning through 
computer media must be familiarized with early on. The challenge that must be faced by educators in 
providing computer-based science learning for early childhood is that not all children know about how 
to use computers. The rule of the game will be different when it compares to the media of paper and 
also an understanding of the content of the material provided. Initial observations showed 82% of 
Kindergarten A group in one school in Surabaya did not know about mixing colors and the school did 
not utilize computer facilities in learning science in children. 
Color Mixing Maze Game is a computer-based game with learning materials about colors and their 
mixing. This game is made by using maze so that children should pass the maze as a challenge other 
than the child must choose the correct answer. This game aims to be a computer-based learning media 
to develop children's science so that children are not only able to recognize primary colors (red, yellow 
and blue) and secondary colors (green, purple and orange), but also know mixing primary colors so 
that they become secondary colors (yellow + blue = green, red + blue = purple, and yellow + red = 
orange).

2.  Method 
This research was conducted in one kindergarten (TK) in Surabaya which has computer facilities 
but has not to use the computers as a learning medium and most (82%) students do not know about 
color mixing. The sample in this study was 23 children (11 boys and 12 girls) aged 4-5 years who 
were in different classes. The first class was A1 with 13 children and an A2 class with 10 children. 
Children in kindergarten A1 were used as research samples for an experimental group and children in 
class A2 were used as a control group. Computer-based “color mixing maze games” were used for 
science learning activities through symbolic thinking skills in the experimental group. Color mixing 
maze paper-based games were used for the control group. 
This research used the Quasi-experiment method and Non-equivalent Control Group Design 
because this research used two groups, the experimental group, and the control group, by looking at 
the results of the pre-test and post-test. The experimental group was given science learning through 
“color mixing maze games” that are used to recognize primary colors and mixing colors (secondary 
colors). The instrument in this study consisted of five items that were analyzed with an independent 
sample t-test with N-Gain because it tested the differences in the two groups that were paired with 
results that were normally distributed and homogeneous.

The assessment or collection of data was carried out by observation of the results of the pre-test 
and post-test conducted with the assessment criteria by the provisions in the curriculum for PAUD, 
which used four assessment criteria. The assessment criteria in this study were very well-developed 
(BSB = Score 4), well-developed according to expectations (BSH = Score 3), starting to develop (MB 
= Score 2), and not yet developed (BB = Score 1). 
These research instruments were used after conducting the reliability and validity and has passed 
the tests of normality and homogeneity using SPSS 21. The analysis used both for test requirements 
and hypotheses was a simple independent t-test with N-Gain. The effectiveness of the color mixing 
maze game was calculated with the N-Gain formula which was [10]:

The hypotheses in this research are as follows: 
Ha: There is a difference in the effectiveness of computer-based “color mixing maze games” 
compared to paper-based games to stimulate symbolic thought in the development of science in early 
childhood. 
Ho: There is no difference in the effectiveness of computer-based “color mixing maze games” 
compared to paper-based games to stimulate symbolic thought in the development of science in early 
childhood. 
3.  Results and Discussion 
The purpose of this study was to determine differences in the effectiveness of computer-based “color 
mixing maze games” compared to paper-based games for early childhood science development 
through stimulating symbolic thinking. A simple independent t-test analysis with G-Gain was the most 
appropriate analysis in this study. 
3.1.  Results 
The following are the results of calculations from the N-Gain test obtained from the SPSS 21 results 
which are then used in the test requirements and hypothesis analysis:

In table 3, it can be seen that the highest N-Gain value in the experimental group was 1.2 and the 
lowest was 0.4 so that 4 children are included in the medium category and 9 children are included in 
the high category. Meanwhile, the highest value in the control group was 0.7 and the lowest was -0.3, 
thus 5 children are included in the low category and 5 children are included in the medium category.

Based on table 9 which is generated from the calculation of the simple independent test with N-
Gain, it can be seen the significance of the effectiveness of “color mixing maze games” in early 
childhood science development, which is 0.000, which means it is smaller than 0.05 (0.000≤0.05). 
Based on these results it is stated that Ho was rejected and Ha was accepted which means there was a 
difference in the effectiveness of computer-based “color mixing maze games” compared to paper-

In table 10, it can be seen that the average value of N-Gain in the experimental group was 0.8 and 
in the control group was 0.2 based on the N-gain level category in table 2, it is stated that the 
computer-based experimental group has a high level of effectiveness with a value of 0.8> 0.7 (g> 0.7). 
Meanwhile, the paper-based control group has a low level of effectiveness with a value of 0.2 <0.3 (g 
<0.7). 
3.2.  Discussion 
Technology, including a computer, is important for education that can make teaching and learn more 
interesting and enjoyable for children. Learning that integrates humans and technology or machinery is 
a demand that must be mastered both by teachers and children during the fourth industrial revolution

today. It is a fact that many children (82%) do not know about colors and color-mixing as important 
symbols in human life. This is the background of making a "color-mixing maze game" to measure how 
important and effective learning is through computer-based games. 
Based on the calculation results of a simple independent test with N-Gain, it can be seen the 
importance of the effectiveness of "color-mixing maze game" in the development of early childhood 
science with a value of less than 0.05 (0.000≤ 0.05) so that it can be interpreted that Ho was rejected 
and Ha was accepted, which means there was a significant difference in the effectiveness of computer-
based "color-mixing maze game" compared to paper-based games to stimulate symbolic thinking in 
the development of science in early childhood. 
The results of this study are in line with a research from Shobary, et al (2014) which concluded that 
the applications (computer games or color-mixing maze games) can be an alternative in learning 
because the material is interestingly packaged and helps in the process of learning material 
understanding the mixing of primary colors into secondary colors significantly compared to paper-
based learning [11]. This study is also in line with research conducted by Vitianingsih (2016) which 
based on the results of her research concluded that educational games (computer-based color-mixing 
maze games) can help significantly in facilitating early childhood students to recognize symbols 
(colors) compared to paper-based learning [12]. 
Computer-based color-mixing maze game is stated to be able to provide the right understanding in 
the learning process including science learning in recognizing colors that will train children in 
symbolic thinking so that in this way can improve children's cognitive abilities in the development of 
science learning. This is in line with the opinion of Klisch, Y, Miller, L, Wang, S and Epstein, J (2012) 
which states that computer-based game for education is very effective in efforts to increase knowledge 
about the content of the material delivered in the game including material about recognizing color 
symbols and color-mixing [13]. 
Learning in the form of computer-based games is stated to be more effective than paper-based in 
recognizing color-mixing because experience in playing games can contain delight elements and can 
be learned repeatedly without having to think about the many tools and materials to be used [14]. This 
supports the obtained results of the research that is based on the results of N-Gain calculations, it can 
be stated that the average N-Gain value of the experimental group was 0.7 with a maximum value of 
1.2 and a minimum value of 0.4. The average value of N-Gain in the experimental group was 0.2 with 
a maximum value of 0.7 and a minimum value of -0.3. Based on the N-gain level category in table 2, it 
is stated that the computer-based experimental class has a high level of effectiveness while the paper-
based control class has a low level of effectiveness. 
Another advantage of computer-based games (color-mixing maze game) is stated by Schrader, PG, 
& Mc Creery, M (2012) that computer-based games can provide direct feedback, repetition in 
learning, interactivity aspects, and representations of virtual reality so that they are considered more 
beneficial than other learning methods and are considered effective in learning color symbol and color 
mixing [15]. Udosen, Alice, Uwakmfon Samuel Ekpo (2016) further strengthened his opinion that 
learning through computer-based games (color-mixing maze game) serves as a complement to the 
practices used in teaching and measuring the improvement of children's abilities including in the 
ability to think symbolically by recognizing color symbols and color mixing as part of learning science 
[16]. 
4.  Conclusions 
This study aims to determine the differences in the effectiveness of computer-based "color-mixing 
maze game" compared to the paper-based games for the development of early childhood science to 
stimulate symbolic thinking. The results of the effectiveness test showed that through analysis it was 
known that the Significance value was 0.00≤0.05 so that Ho was rejected and Ha was accepted, which 
mean that there was a significant difference in the effectiveness of computer-based "color-mixing 
maze games" compared to the paper-based games to stimulate symbolic thinking in scientific 
development knowledge in early childhood. Computer-based "color-mixing maze games" are stated to

be able to provide the right understanding in the learning process including science learning in 
recognizing mixing colors that will train children in symbolic thinking, so that in this way it can 
improve children's cognitive abilities in the development of science learning. The computer-based 
experimental group has a high level of effectiveness with a value of 0.8> 0.7 while the paper-based 
control group has a low level of effectiveness with a value of 0.2 <0.3. Learning in the form of 
computer-based games is stated to be more effective than paper-based in recognizing color-mixing 
because experience in playing games can contain delight elements and can be learned repeatedly 
without having to think about the many tools and materials to be used.
