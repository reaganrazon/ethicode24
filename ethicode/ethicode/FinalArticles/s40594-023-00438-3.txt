Abstract 
Background Early exposure to Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) for all is critical to broaden 
participation and promote equity in the field. But how does the introduction of CS and CT into primary school cur‑
ricula impact learning, perception, and gaps between groups of students?
Methodology We investigate a CS‑curricular reform and teacher Professional Development (PD) programme 
from an equity standpoint by applying hierarchical regression and structural equation modelling on student learn‑
ing and perception data from three studies with, respectively, 1384, 2433 and 1644 grade 3–6 students (ages 7–11) 
and their 83, 142 and 95 teachers.
Results Regarding learning, exposure to CS instruction appears to contribute to closing the performance gap 
between low‑achieving and high‑achieving students, as well as pre‑existing gender gaps. Despite a lack of direct 
influence of what was taught on student learning, there is no impact of teachers’ demographics or motivation on stu‑
dent learning, with teachers’ perception of the CS‑PD positively influencing learning. Regarding perception, students 
perceive CS and its teaching tools (robotics, tablets) positively, and even more so when they perceive a role model 
close to them as doing CS. Nonetheless, gender differences exist all around with boys perceiving CS more positively 
than girls despite access to CS education. However, access to CS‑education affects boys and girls differently: larger 
gender gaps are closing (namely those related to robotics), while smaller gaps are increasing (namely those related 
to CS and tablets).
Conclusion This article highlights how a CS curricular reform impacts learning, perception, and equity and sup‑
ports the importance of (i) early introductions to CS for all; (ii) preparing teachers to teach CS all the while removing 
the influence of teacher demographics and motivation on student outcomes; and (iii) having developmentally appro‑
priate activities that signal to all groups of students.

Introduction and related work
Introducing computer science and computational thinking 
for all from an equity perspective
The past decades have seen a growing international con-
sensus regarding the importance of teaching Computer 
Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) to ensure 
that students are digitally literate (Webb et  al., 2017). 
Computing is increasingly ubiquitous in today’s societies, 
thus leading to CS being more and more often consid-
ered as a subset of STEM education which must be ren-
dered as available to students as mathematics or science 
education (Guzdial & Morrison, 2016). Introducing CS 
into formal education is also considered to foster Com-
putational Thinking (CT), an essential skill for everyone 
in the twenty-first century (Jiang & Wong, 2022; Zhang 
et  al., 2023) which is as important as reading, writing, 
and arithmetics (Wing, 2006). Teaching CT is not only 
considered by researchers to benefit STEM-related dis-
ciplines (Hurt et al., 2023; Swaid, 2015), but is also con-
sidered transversal. The benefits of CT are thought to go 
beyond CS or mathematics (Denning & Tedre, 2021; Li 
et al., 2020; Mannila et al., 2014; Weintrop, 2021; Wein-
trop et  al., 2016; Zhang et  al., 2023), extending to arts 
(Zhang et  al., 2023), with new evidence even showing 
that young students employ CT during free play (Kot-
sopoulos et al., 2022), thus providing an additional lever 
to introduce both CS and CT to all. Although studies on 
K-12 CS education and CT have increased significantly in 
recent years (Apiola et al., 2023; Bers et al., 2022b; Hsu 
et al., 2018), introducing CS and CT into curricula has 
been a challenge internationally.
Ottenbreit-Leftwich 
and 
Yadav 
(2022) 
recently 
expressed the importance of a “system-wide implemen-
tation of CT” from an equity perspective to ensure that 
all students are introduced to CT, and not just those of 
a select number of teachers who choose to teach CT. 
This is echoed by Bers et al. (2022b) who advocate that 
exposure to CS and CT should happen in early founda-
tional years (ages 3–8) “from a social equity perspective 
to prevent stereotypes and ensure [that] all young chil-
dren receive equal opportunities to develop their digital 
literacy”. Two key points emerge from this discourse and 
must be addressed to broaden participation and promote 
equity in these fields:
• Structural barriers are access-related and limit (early) 
CS and CT experiences for all, but can be addressed 
through curricular reforms (Ottenbreit-Leftwich & 
Yadav, 2022).
• Social barriers, often stereotype (and therefore gen-
der) related, arise despite equal access and regardless 
of socioeconomic status (Wang & Hejazi Moghadam, 
2017), but can be addressed through early exposure 
to mitigate the effects of existing stereotypes (Bers 
et al., 2022b).
The consequence of social and structural barriers is that 
disparities are present at multiple levels, including per-
formance (i.e. learning) and attitudes towards CS (i.e. per-
ception). Such disparities ultimately contribute to having 
under-represented groups in CS and CT-related fields, 
and must therefore be addressed in order to increase the 
likelihood that a more diverse and inclusive set of people 
persist in these fields. In the following sections, we delve 
into the literature and highlight the disparities that exist 
due to such barriers, particularly in terms of learning and 
perception.
The influence of social and structural barriers 
on learning‑related equity
Several studies have shown that unequal access to (high-
quality) CS education (Bers et al., 2022b; Wang & Hejazi 
Moghadam, 2017)  contributes to performance gaps. In 
particular, a recent large-scale analysis of performance 
with 46,000 students from 14 countries conducted by 
Karpinski et  al. (2021) found that socioeconomic back-
ground, and therefore access, was related to persistent 
gaps in CT performance. Their findings indicated that 
students from “less advantaged backgrounds had lower 
levels of computer skills [...], especially in CT” (Karpin-
ski et al., 2021). Unfortunately, regardless of access, sev-
eral studies have found that boys perform better than 
girls (El-Hamamsy et al., 2022c; Kong & Lai, 2022b; Polat 
et al., 2021; Román-González et al., 2017), even in kin-
dergarten (Sullivan & Bers, 2016), due to the existence 
of stereotypes (see “ The influence of social and struc-
tural barriers on equity related to the perception of the 
discipline”).
Although access to developmentally appropriate CS & 
CT education can increase students’ skills from a young 
age (Bers et al., 2014; 2022a, b; Hall & McCormick, 2022; 
Relkin et al. 2021), several studies suggest that perception 
of the discipline can also influence performance (Hinckle 
et al., 2020; Rachmatullah et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022). 
Rachmatullah et  al. (2022) for instance found that the 
gender-performance gap was more prevalent in coun-
tries where the “socio-cultural context” tends to promote 
such stereotypes and “influenc[e] gender diversity in the 
CS field”. Their findings are corroborated by Hinckle et al. 
(2020) who found that student learning was not directly 
influenced by prior experience, but was mediated by their 
perception of CS. Numerous studies in higher educa-
tion have also found that motivational and affective fac-
tors influence performance and participation in the field 
(Lishinski et  al., 2022), and that they are influenced by 
Page 3 of 43

gender and ethnicity (Lishinski et al., 2022; Warner et al., 
2022). These studies confirm the importance of:
• developing CS and CT initiatives that broaden par-
ticipation to all students,
• considering their impact on performance and per-
ception to verify whether the gaps between different 
groups of participants are decreasing.
The influence of social and structural barriers on equity 
related to the perception of the discipline
Perception-related biases are considered to contribute 
to disparities and under-representation in CS for women 
(Rachmatullah et  al., 2022; Wang & Hejazi Moghadam, 
2017), and more generally for under-represented minori-
ties (Lishinski et al., 2022; Warner et al., 2022), due to ste-
reotype threat (i.e. conforming to/inducing a stereotype 
simply because you know it exists). Unfortunately, the 
developmental literature has found that basic stereotypes 
develop in children as young as 2–3 years old (Bers et al., 
2022b). This is confirmed by multiple studies that identi-
fied CS-related stereotypes in young children (e.g. start-
ing 6 years old, Master et al. 2021, and even kindergarten, 
Sullivan & Bers, 2016). The result is that when students 
are exposed to negative CS-stereotypes, students in the 
stereotyped group (e.g. girls in this case) tend to endorse 
those beliefs (Plante et al., 2013; Vandenberg et al., 2021) 
which negatively impacts their performance, motiva-
tion, and career intentions (Master & Meltzoff, 2020; 
Plante et al., 2013; Vandenberg et al., 2021). For instance, 
Cheryan et al. (2013) found that women who were pre-
sented non-stereotypical views on computer scientists 
were more likely to express an interest in majoring in 
CS. Therefore, students may make early career decisions 
informed by such stereotypes, contributing to an early 
gender gap (Wang & Hejazi Moghadam, 2017), and long-
term disparities in the fields of CS and engineering (Mas-
ter et al., 2021).
As gender-related stereotypes are prevalent, it is not 
surprising that numerous studies find that girls perceive 
CS more negatively than boys (El-Hamamsy et al., 2023c; 
Kong et al., 2018; Vandenberg et al., 2021; Witherspoon 
et al., 2016), contributing to a lower sense of belonging 
(Cheryan et  al., 2013, 2017; Opps & Yadav, 2022; Van-
denberg et  al., 2021), self-efficacy (Beyer, 2014; Kong 
et al., 2018; Vandenberg et al., 2021), and interest (Beyer, 
2014; Master et  al., 2021). Provided the importance of 
such factors for academic achievement and career deci-
sions (Bandura, 1993; Beyer, 2014; Howard et al., 2021a; 
Olivier et al., 2019), the consequence is that CS “suffers 
from the lowest participation of girls than other sci-
ence, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) 
subjects (Cheryan et al., 2017)" (Hinckle et al., 2020; Jiang 
& Wong, 2022). As prior experience may positively affect 
attitudes toward CS (Hinckle et  al., 2020), researchers 
have suggested that engaging early in CS-related activi-
ties that “signal equally to both girls and boys that they 
belong and can succeed” (Cheryan et  al., 2017) in CS, 
may increase girls’ interest, and ultimately contribute to 
addressing gender equity in the field (Cheryan et al. 2017; 
Hinckle et  al., 2020; Jiang & Wong, 2022). Therefore, 
in the rest of the article we refer to perception-related 
equity as the reduction of the influence of stereotypes 
around CS & CT that lead to biases between groups of 
people (namely gender) and may influence their motiva-
tion, engagement, participation and persistence in these 
fields.
How are CS and CT curricular reforms having an impact 
and contributing to equity in these fields?
Early CS and CT opportunities for all students are essen-
tial to address structural and social barriers, broaden 
CS participation, and promote equity in the field. An 
increasing number of initiatives have therefore sought to 
include CS and CT in compulsory K-12 worldwide (Bal-
anskat & Engelhardt, 2015; Bers et  al., 2022b; Bocconi 
et al., 2022;  European Union and Education, 2019; Hub-
wieser et al., 2015; Voogt et al., 2015; Webb et al., 2017). 
In this context, it is essential to establish how such initia-
tives affect students (Guskey, 2002). This should extend 
beyond learning to include perception, and investigate 
how these dimensions interrelate (Hinckle et  al., 2020) 
to ensure that expanding CS to K-12 “neither exacerbates 
existing equity gaps in education nor hinders efforts to 
diversify the field of CS” (Wang & Hejazi Moghadam, 
2017). The student-level impact of widespread CS and 
CT curricular reforms, and professional development 
(PD) programmes, is however seldom evaluated. “Stud-
ies that relate student’s learning achievement and teach-
ers’ capacity building are still rare in the literature of CT 
(Mason & Rich, 2019)” (Kong & Lai, 2022a). This is likely 
due to the difficulties countries face implementing CS & 
CT reforms, including adequately training a sufficient 
number of teachers to teach the new concepts (Bocconi 
et  al., 2022; El-Hamamsy et  al., 2021b). Difficulties of 
assessing teachers’ mastery of Computational Pedagogi-
cal Content Knowledge (Hickmott & Prieto-Rodriguez, 
2018), and what is implemented after PD programmes 
(El-Hamamsy et al., 2022a) also exist, despite their direct 
influence on student learning (Kong & Lai, 2022a). To the 
best of our knowledge, only Kong & Lai (2022a) linked 81 
teachers’ content knowledge with 3226 students’ achieve-
ment in their evaluation of a PD programme. However, 
these teachers chose to participate in the PD programme 
and were required to teach a year-long curriculum. This

differs significantly from mandatory curricular reform 
contexts, where the PD programme is imposed on all 
teachers, resulting in teachers who implement the peda-
gogical content to varying degrees, if at all. Since a pre-
requisite to achieving equity is that CS-related reforms 
have an impact, the lack of studies evaluating the impact 
of CS reforms means that there is little insight into 
whether these reforms are contributing to equity and 
reducing learning and perception gaps between different 
groups of students.
Since a “K-12 curriculum is a zero-sum game, where 
adding a subject means [removing] something” (Otten-
breit-Leftwich & Yadav, 2022), it is essential to establish 
the effectiveness of implementing CS & CT curricula in 
formal education. Evaluating a reform’s effectiveness is 
critical given:
• the need to improve corresponding PD programmes 
and curricula (Hickmott & Prieto-Rodriguez, 2018),
• the objective of sustaining the reform in teachers’ 
practices (Hubers, 2020),
• the importance of alleviating concerns of fund-
ing agencies and government bodies regarding the 
impact of the reform and PD programme on teachers 
(Hickmott & Prieto-Rodriguez, 2018) and students.
Studies evaluating the impact of reforms are even more 
pressing since recent findings indicate that teachers are 
not necessarily convinced that their students are learning 
as a result of teaching these novel curricula (El-Hamamsy 
et  al., 2023b; Toh, 2016) . Establishing the benefits at 
the student-level is therefore not only necessary to have 
a complete evaluation of reforms (Avry et  al., 2022; 
El-Hamamsy et  al., 2023b; Guskey, 2000), but is essen-
tial if the objective is to promote teachers’ decisions to 
continue to implement a new practice in the long term 
(Howard et al., 2021b; Klingner et al., 2001).
Problem statement and research questions
The present study therefore looks to contribute to under-
standing the influence of CS curricular reforms on stu-
dent learning and perception and determining to what 
extent they contribute to equity with respect to: (i) gen-
der, i.e. reducing significant differences between boys’ 
and girls’ perception and performance; (ii) performance, 
i.e. reducing significant differences between initially low 
and high performers; and (iii) self-efficacy, i.e. reducing 
significant differences between students who have low 
or high self-efficacy. Please note that although the main 
focus of the article is on the former equity dimensions, 
one must not neglect the importance of equity in terms 
of socioeconomic status (Vandenberg et al., 2021; Wang 
& Hejazi Moghadam, 2017), a dimension which we did 
not have access to in the present context.
We propose to address the overarching question of 
equity in two steps: first investigating whether and how 
the reform significantly influences perception and learn-
ing (impact), and then how the results differ according 
to student populations (equity). To that effect, we inves-
tigate the impact of a mandatory CS curricular reform 
and teacher PD programme (see “Context: a computer 
science curricular reform for all to promote equity start-
ing primary school”) to understand whether and how 
the primary school Computer Science curricular reform 
is contributing to reaching equity goals (i.e. broadening 
participation in the field to a larger number and a more 
diverse set of people). We therefore consider the follow-
ing research questions: 
(RQ1) 
 How does teaching CS pedagogical con-
tent1 impact student learning? And how 
does it impact learning-related gender- and 
performance-equity?
(RQ2) 
 How does teaching CS pedagogical content 
impact students’ perception of CS and the tools 
used to teach it (i.e. robots and tablets)? And 
how does it impact perception-related self-effi-
cacy and gender-equity?
To answer these questions, we employ data collected 
between January 2021 and June 2022 in the context of 
a mandatory primary school CS-curricular reform that 
is presently being deployed to all grade 1–6 teachers in 
the region after a piloting phase. The data stem from 
three studies (see Table 1), the first on student learning 
(RQ1), the second on perception of the discipline and 
performance (RQ1, RQ2), and the third on perception 
of the discipline (RQ2). These studies involved, respec-
tively,  n1 = 1384 , n2 = 2433 and n3 = 1644 grade 3–6 
students (ages 7–11) and their n1 = 83 , n2 = 142 and 
n3 = 95 teachers. The data are analysed through hierar-
chical linear modelling for student learning, and Struc-
tural Equation Modelling for perception, to establish 
the link between teaching CS and these key outcome 
variables.
Context: a computer science curricular reform 
for all to promote equity starting at primary school
The research is part of a large-scale project seeking to 
introduce Digital Education (also referred to as Com-
puting Education) as a new discipline for all students in 
1 CS pedagogical content refers to pedagogical activities that intend to teach 
students about CS, as opposed to those that employ CS as a tool to teach in 
other disciplines.

the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland (El-Hamamsy et al., 
2021b). The curricular reform relies on the collabora-
tion between four institutions in the region (the depart-
ment of education, the university of teacher education, a 
higher education university and the technical university) 
within a research practice partnership to develop the 
curriculum and corresponding mandatory teacher-PD 
programme for CS, Information and Communication 
Technology and Digital Citizenship. To ensure the sus-
tainability and scalability of the reform, the project began 
with a piloting phase with 10 representative schools from 
the region (hereby referred to as CS-schools) before 
large-scale deployment. The CS-curriculum and teacher 
PD-programme was piloted for the first time and itera-
tively adjusted for grades 1–4 in 2018–2019, and for 
grades 5–6 in 2019–2020, with all the teachers from the 
10 CS-schools (approximately ngrades1−4 = 350 , and 
ngrades5−6 = 180)2. This resulted in a reference manual3 
containing pedagogical activities (for CS, ngrades1−4 = 13 , 
ngrades5−6 = 12 ) that the teachers can choose from to 
achieve the curricular objectives (in terms of algorithms 
and languages, machines and networks, information 
and data, and the impact of CS on society). The teachers 
were trained to teach these activities during a mandatory 
CS-PD that they participated in prior to the present study 
and were encouraged to teach the novel discipline which 
is now part of the regional study plan. They were how-
ever not required to do so. Given that in primary school 
there is no dedicated hour in the grid for Digital Educa-
tion (and thus CS), and that the discipline is not evalu-
ated, this leads to a large variability in both what and 
how much is taught. This therefore required analysing 
the student-level impact of the curricular reform, and the 
influence being taught specific pedagogical content by 
teachers (which we refer to as adoption). While the ini-
tial focus was on student learning (see study 1 in “Study 
1: student learning and the link with what teachers from 
the CS-schools implemented”), a parallel pilot study in 
grade 9 (ages 13–14) in Spring 2021 indicated that there 
were already significant perception-related gender gaps 
(El-Hamamsy et al., 2023c). This lead to the introduction 
of a student perception survey in Fall 2021 (see studies 2 
and 3 in “Study 2: student perception, the link with what 
teachers from the CS-schools implemented, and correla-
tions with performance” and “Study 3: student perception 
between CS-schools and schools where teachers were 
not yet trained to teach computer science”) to determine 
when gender gaps appear and whether teaching CS con-
tributes to closing these gaps.

teachers from the CS‑schools implemented
Methodology (study 1)
Participants and data collection (study 1)
The first study follows all the grade 3–4 students from 
7 CS-schools over 6 months to evaluate learning in a 
pre- post-test design. These students were all introduced 
to CS for the first time during the 2018–2019 academic 
year and therefore had approximately 2 years of prior 
CS experience. The objective of the study was therefore 
to see to what extent these students progressed over that 
time period in relation to what they were taught. Given 
the scale of the study, the objective was to focus on a sub-
set of the learning objectives that could be measured in a 
valid and reliable way, and at a large scale, in grades 3–6. 
We therefore chose to focus on the CT-concepts defined

by Brennan and Resnick (2012)4 which align with the 
region’s CS curricular objectives (sequences, loops, con-
ditionals, and while statements), all the while considering 
what the teachers taught between the pre- and post-tests. 
To that effect, we employed the competent Computa-
tional Thinking test (cCTt, El-Hamamsy et al., 2022c), a 
25-item CT-concepts’ assessment (see example questions 
in Fig.  1) originally developed and validated for grades 
3–4 that evaluates CS concepts of sequences, loops, if-
else statements and while statements. This instrument 
was later validated for grades 3–6, including a Differen-
tial Item Functioning analysis which demonstrates that 
the cCTt is not biased towards genders (i.e. it is gender 
fair) and can therefore be used to measure significant dif-
ferences between boys’ and girls’ responses (El-Hamamsy 
et al., 2023d).
The student-learning data were complemented by data 
on teachers’ perception of CS and the CS-PD acquired in 
January 2021, and data regarding what teachers taught 
(which we refer to as adoption) between January and 
June 2021 (see Table 2). The adoption data are based on 
the activities that the teachers were introduced to dur-
ing their CS professional development programme and is 
collected in the form of a number of periods per activ-
ity which we are then able to convert into boolean values 
and derive the amount of CS activities taught.
Please note that the data sets include missing data due 
to (i) students not being present for either the full pre- 
and/or post- tests, (ii) teachers not administering the 
test, or (iii) teachers not answering the pre- and/or post- 
teacher survey. As the analyses combine multiple data 
sets, a synthesis of the number of students and teachers 
for which the full responses are available with respect to 
the data subsets considered is provided in Table 3. Finally, 
while it would have been interesting to have a control 
group to be able to infer how learning compared between 
students who had access to CS courses and those who 
did not, the administration of a performance assessment 
to students in non-CS-schools was not authorised due 
to ethical concerns. Nonetheless, given the variability in 
what the teachers taught, 4 grade 3 classes and 6 grade 4 
classes did not receive any CS education and thus provide 
an interesting point of comparison. As the second data 
subset (test + adoption data) constitutes the core of the 
analysis, we provide more detailed demographics infor-
mation in Appendix A.1 in Table 10.
Analysis methodology (study 1)
The student learning data are analysed in three stages.
First, the January and June test data ( n = 1319 ) are 
analysed using multiple ANOVA with Benjamini–Hoch-
berg p-value correction to reduce the false discovery rate 
(study 1a). The results are reported as significant (i.e. 
p < 0.05 ) only if the minimum effect size (Cohen’s D5) 
required to achieve a statistical power of 0.8 is reached 
with α = 0.05 . Dunn’s post hoc test is then applied for

4 Brennan and Resnick (2012)’s operational definition of CT decomposes 
CT into CT concepts (i.e. the concepts that computer scientists engage 
with), practices (i.e. the processes they employ to resolve computational 
problems) and perspectives (i.e. their perception of CT). Please note that at 
the time of the study there were no valid, reliable and scalable instruments 
to measure CT-practices and perspectives.
5 Cohen’s D is a means of quantifying the difference between the means of 
two samples ( µ1 , µ2 ) all the while accounting for their standard deviations 
( sd1 and sd2 ). Cohen’s D is therefore computed as the difference between the 
two sample’s means divided by the pooled standard deviation ( sp ). There-
fore, Cohen’s D = µ1−µ2

 . The rule of thumb to inter-
pret Cohen’s D is as follows: if around 0.2 the effect is considered small, if 
around 0.5 the effect is considered medium and if around 0.8 or above the 
effect is considered large.
