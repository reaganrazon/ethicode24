CSCL: Unit 1 Grade 4
Lesson 1.6: Computing Technologies Are
Changing the World
Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
❖ Gain an awareness of how
computing technologies are
changing our world.
❖ Be able to identify how specific
devices have changed the way we
operate in the world.
❖ Be able to brainstorm and express
ideas of devices that can impact
and improve human lives.
Preparation
❏ Print student activity worksheet,
one per team of 2-3.
❏ Students will need their journal or
a piece of paper for the first
student activity.
❏ Although the video content is more
advanced, you may want to watch
the listed videos in resources as
background information.

1. How Computing Technologies Have Changed the Way We Live
Engage students in a teacher led discussion:
Technology has changed so many things we do almost on a daily basis, such as making
phone calls, communicating with others, traveling, watching movies,....
Note: Some of the prior methods of doing things may need to be explained to
students that are not familiar with them such as film cameras.
Examples:
Activity
Before
Now
Watching Movies
VCR, TV, DVDs
Streaming Video
Phones
Cable Home phones and
rotary phones
Cell phone, Smart phone
Photos
Load camera with film
Smart phone
Written Communication
Mailed letters, telegram.
Text, Chat, Instagram
Driving
Traditional car
Self driving car
[Prompt students to come up
with their own examples]
Written communication
Navigation
Games
Further ideas after
students come up with
their own:
Handwritten

2. Student Activity: From “Happy Birthday Dear Eric” to
Students discuss how written communication has changed the way people
communicate

1. In your team discuss how written communication has changed the way we
communicate. During the American Revolution, people sent letters to each other
which was slow and unreliable. The recipient would have to wait a few days to weeks
for a letter to arrive depending on the destination of the letter. Many people still write
letters, but it has mostly been replaced thanks to new technologies.
2. Discuss what types of written communication people use today and which
technologies have allowed this to change. Write down 2- 3 of your ideas.
3. Discuss and write down the benefits of the new way of communicating.
4. Be prepared to share your ideas with the class.
After the activity, prompt students to share their ideas with the class.
3. Can a Mobile Device Know You Have a Cold?
Dogs are some of our best friends. That’s especially true after a disaster, such as an
earthquake. When buildings collapse, search-and-rescue dogs help find people
trapped beneath the rubble. Dogs’ amazing noses can pick up the scent of survivors.
Dogs can also sniff hidden drugs and explosives.
Unfortunately, it is very
expensive to train a dog, they
may not always be up for the
task and they can’t work for
very many years.
Because smells can tell us so
much about ourselves and our
environment, scientists are
developing the sense of smell in
machines, sometimes called an
electronic nose. Lots of tiny
sensors are able to pick up
scents, process the information and decide what the smell is. These tiny sensors that ‘smell’
are small enough to fit inside a smartphone and other mobile devices, feeding information
about the scent to a computer system that can analyze the data and tell us what the scent is.

These electronic noses will hopefully be able to be used to find survivors like dogs do, but
scientists are also developing them to detect diseases in humans. We might be able to
breathe into a smartphone or a handheld electronic device and it might be able to tell us if we
are sick. As one scientist put it, “Your phone might know you have a cold before you do.”
Optionally show the “How Does an Electronic Nose Work” video if appropriate for your class
(https://tinyurl.com/y2ohhof2).
4. Student Activity: Life Changing Electronic Devices
We learned how an electronic nose can be useful and how it might help in the
medicine field. What if we had an electronic eye device?
Students may work as a team or on their own for this activity (simply tell them to replace ‘our’
with ‘my’ if working alone). Explain the activity to students and distribute the activity
worksheet.
Allow time for students to share and discuss their ideas with the class.
5. Wrap Up and Reflections
Reflection Points:
●
How is technology changing the way we live?
●
Do you think technology is making our lives easier or harder?
●
How are our lives different because of technology?

Student Activity:
Life Changing Electronic Devices
You learned about an electronic nose. Now you will share your own invention! Be
prepared to share with the class. Every team member will share at least one
item.
What to do:
1) Your team had an amazing breakthrough and your new
electronic eye is ready to see where no eye has seen
before!
Our electronic eye is called ______________________
Our electronic eye can see (examples:
in the dark, x number of feet away, in
certain places where it is difficult to see,.....)
