Abstract. This longitudinal study examined the development of pedagogical knowledge of 
teacher‘s participation in a 2-year professional development program that enhanced teacher’s 
self-efficacy and prompted changes in science instruction in the elementary grades. The 
purpose of this research was to implement STEM activities which are developed by a 
professional team. A professional learning community (PLC) was used as a professional 
development tool helping the teacher increase her Pedagogical Content Knowledge. 
Collaborative design of STEM science lessons, implementation of the lessons and reflection on 
outcomes. Collaboration among the educator and teachers was offered in the form of online 
learning materials, exemplary lessons and the availability of an expert. The researcher 
participated for one year in the program. Results showed significant increases in teacher’s 
overall self-efficacy in teaching science, personal efficacy, and outcome expectancy efficacy 
during the 2 years. The increase of self-efficacy was presented with changes in improved 
instructional practices, particularly student participation activities. The educators and experts 
were important in providing pedagogical support during the design and implementation, and 
reflected with teachers on how to improve on their teaching. 
1.  Introduction 
Building individuals with good knowledge and understanding of Science and Technology have 
become the main goals of national education programs. Thai science education has advocated infusing 
21st century skills into the school curriculum and several educational levels have participated in such 
efforts. Thai educational institutions that focus on STEM, such as the Office of Basic Education 
Commission (OBEC), The Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology (IPST), 
Phuket Rajabhat University STEM Education Center (PKRU STEM Education Center) and Chevron 
Enjoys Science projects.  
STEM is a curriculum based on the idea of educating students in four specific disciplines — 
science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Integrated approaches to STEM (science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics) education are increasingly popular, but remain challenging 
and elusive. There is much hope that integrated approaches to STEM education can help the next 
generation of students to solve real-world problems by applying concepts that cut across disciplines as 
well as capacities of critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity [1]. However, most teachers have

received training in only one discipline [3], and most schools and classes at all levels still have 
separate departments and class periods for the STEM subjects. Therein lies a significant challenge for 
educators and administrators interested in promoting integrated STEM. 
Lesson design, Planning is an essential aspect of effective teaching. Planning begins with a design 
of units of study, and continues in the development of a sequence of lessons crafted to achieve the 
goals of the unit. Units are large chunks of the curriculum. Each unit contains multiple lessons and the 
lessons provide a pathway to mastery of the big idea. Each lesson should be an important step toward 
the goals of the unit. 
Characteristics of a Good Lesson [2] 
To plan effective lessons, you begin with the end – what are the outcomes you want from the 
lesson? What knowledge, skills, and attitudes will students possess if the lesson is successful? All 
lessons have the same basic structure: clear objectives, activities that provide students opportunities to 
meet the objectives, an introduction that activates prior knowledge and introduces questions that the 
teacher uses to check for understanding, and independent work in which students apply the concepts 
under varying degrees of difficulty. 
So the essential elements of the lesson design are: 
1. The objectives are set first and drive the design. 
2. There is an opening that activates students’ prior knowledge. 
3. The lesson provides clear direction for students. 
4. The teacher models or demonstrates the work to be done. 
5. There is an opportunity for guide practice.  
6. There are opportunities for teachers to check for understanding. 
7. There is an opportunity for independent work. 
8. There is a closing and summation of what was learned. 
Goals identified in the framework include building STEM literacy and 21st century competencies; 
developing a STEM-capable workforce; and boosting interest and engagement in STEM. In terms of 
outcomes, the framework considers learning and achievement; and the ability to transfer 
understanding across STEM disciplines. Regarding the nature and scope of integration, the framework 
addresses which subjects are connected; which disciplines are dominant; and the duration, size, and 
complexity of an initiative. With respect to implementation, the framework focuses on instructional 
designs involving problem-based learning and engineering design; professional development and 
development of professional learning communities; and adjustments to the learning environment, such 
as extended class periods, extended lesson planning, team teaching, and partnering between STEM 
educators experts and teachers. 
Watsuwankeereewong School is located in Patong, a major tourist attraction in the world. The 
students have migrated or have moved out from parents who come to work in Patong, and many of the 
student’s behaviors have been observed. Students in school have lower academic achievement. Most 
lack the ability to think and solve problems without reason and are tired of learning, are lazy, and 
unable to connect their knowledge from the classroom to everyday life. As a result, students do not see 
the importance of science. 
For the above reasons. If the teacher cooperates to adjust the teaching and learning and plans together 
the design of learning management, along with observation of teaching together and activities that 
focus on the students, they will be able to practice and think for themselves. Sharing the STEM 
activity design of teachers reflects and improves teaching the community of professional learning 
teachers. It develops students to their full potential, helps people in the 21st century and brings 
research results to effective teaching and learning through professional community processes. It will 
encourage students to recognize the importance and relevance of STEM (science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics)

4.  Data Analysis 
The researcher analyzed documents and underlying knowledge of participants in speaking and writing. 
Data from multiple sources such as teachers’ journals and interviews, field notes from observations 
and card sorting were analyzed by the process of open coding to get the transcripts from the first 
interview, observation, reflection and card sorting, developing initial categories of the participant’s 
technological pedagogical content knowledge and their practice. In developing categories, the 
researcher used a constant comparative method of analyzing multiple sources of data which served to 
triangulate the data in order to increase trustworthiness of the research findings and assertions made.

 2) Creating a corporate culture that is conducive to learning: being a good person, being open 
minded, listening to friends, enhancing the mental state of student teachers by organizing 
psychological activities. 
The second element, the value creation and the shared vision, consists of two sub-components: 
1) Co-ordinate the student's learning goals for understanding. 
2) Define learning together based on the PLC concept: taking experience, exchanging experiences, 
visualizing success, exchanging expectations. 
The Third element 3: Learning from the common practice consists of 3 sub-components: 1) 
Learning together. Collaborative Learning: Designing / Planning / Producing Exchanges. Reflect the 
teaching, and improve teaching 
2) AAR (After action review): Successful exchange not less than one time a month. 
 
The main component 3 evaluates the expected results. 
1) Strong student achievement. 
2) Student behaviour in STEM 
3) Teacher Satisfaction The pattern of creating a professional learning community in schools. 
 
The results of the evaluation of the community-based learning model in vocational schools in Wat 
Suwankeereewong School by contextual experts on the benefits.  The possibility and the accuracy are 
at the highest level. The students in grade 7 - 9 had an average score of 73.14 percent. The teacher of 
Watsuwankeereewong School STEM teaching behaviours were at a higher level. Teachers were 
satisfied with the model of community building, professional learning in schools at a high level. 
6.  Conclusion 
For one year with a collaborative STEM lesson design, and STEM teaching development by building a 
professional learning community, the results showed increases in teacher’s overall self-efficacy in 
teaching science, personal efficacy, and outcome expectancy efficacy. The increase of self-efficacy 
was presented with changes in improved instructional practices, particularly student participation 
activities. This enabled the ability to build a professional learning community of teachers.

Lesson Design consists of these elements: 
 
Understanding the prior achievement of the class. 
 
Clear learning objectives that specify the concepts or skills to be mastered; 
 
Modeling or demonstrating the skills or concepts;  
 
Guided practice to allow students to apply the skills or concepts; and 
 
Checks for understanding that permit the teacher to monitor student progress and when 
necessary adapt instruction to meet the needs of individual students. 
In the Lesson design, teachers were asked to discuss:  
 
Group of Team Learning 
 Member’s role; Group leader, supervisor, communicator, collectors, time controller. 
 
The Cognitive Demand of Classroom Tasks 
 Construction of knowledge, through disciplined inquiry, to produce discourse, products, 
and performances. 
 
Formative Assessment 
 Observations of student work, student responses to teachers’ questions, or on the use of 
techniques that allow students to give continual feedback about whether they understand the 
material. 
7.  Research Implication 
Results showed significant increases in teacher’s overall self-efficacy in teaching science, personal 
efficacy, and outcome expectancy efficacy during the 2 years. The increase of self-efficacy was 
presented with changes in improved instructional practices, particularly student participation activities. 
The educators and experts were important in providing pedagogical support during design and 
implementation, and reflected with teachers on how to improve on their teaching.        
University researchers/ experts are currently facilitating academic-year professional development 
for science coaches within the division to pilot STEM activities in classrooms. This continuing 
investment will build upon the school Professional development model for STEM integration and 
respond to the expressed needs of the participants. The sequential actions of experiencing, questioning, 
analyzing, adapting, envisioning, and reflecting on STEM lesson plans as a vehicle for STEM 
integration in science classrooms
